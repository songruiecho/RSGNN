1:woetothegutless So, how many sexual assaults would there be if Muslims were burned in ovens?
1:4armshiver @woetothegutless Probably a lot less. What's your point?
1:4armshiver The Russians raped millions of German women and children at the end of WWII. Now the German people have to contend with this bunch of savages? How pathetic is it that a country has to cow-tow to a hoard of uncivilized migrants. Take your country back Germany.

0:Nevergofullliberal That's it pass more laws, you know cause paper and ink prevents crime.
0:cdgoldin @Nevergofullliberal Ignorant troll. No one said the new law will prevent crime, just that it will make it easier to prosecute criminals --- which is a good thing.
1:12345abcde no habla deutch.... No means white chicks want you more in Arabic mongrelland German politicians that approved of the refugee invaders are responsible for each and every crime committed by these mongrels! German citizens should kick all politicians and refugee invaders OUT!.

0:cdgoldin @SSBN738G Learn to read. Previous law required a victim to put up a physical struggle before the rapist could be prosecuted.. The new law only requires her to say "no".

0:fdjohnson @SSBN738G Government is the impossibility of reason........... Platoon
1:Catholica The Germans invited this filth into their once-great nation by electing Merkel -- and handed law and order over to the EU bureaucrats in Brussels. Now they are too timid to take their country back.
1:lje51 Until the whole world recognizes Islam for what it is, HATE SPEECH, this type of barbarism will only go on. The Muslims feel it is their right to obey only the laws that they agree with. Sexist attitudes against women are a core belief of Islam.
1:cdgoldin @lje51 If Islam was only hate speech, they wouldn't be a problem, just an annoyance. Unfortunately Islam preaches, teaches, demands, applauds and rewards violent behavior. That is much worse than speech.
1:MortisDei If it's not written in Sharia law (and it's NOT) then they (Muslims) ultimately won't care.
0:cdgoldin @MortisDei It's a shame that you have no idea what you are talking about.

1:FredDBear The Germans better realize real quick that you can't put a "no means no" law in sharia law.
1:dirkshomebiz Of course no means no. But not to a mooh-slum. Germany allowed these terrorist into their country, now live with it.
0:retiredhal @dirkshomebiz I get the impression that the German people really didn't have much of a say in it. Just another of example of Merkel/Obama progressivness.

1:liberalstupidity The problem was never the law or lack of a law, it was the immigrants the politicians let into the country.
1:holygrailer @liberalstupidity And its the reason-one of them anyway that some Muzlim countries do not even allow one of these scumbags into their country. NOT ONE! They knew what would happen with these uncivilized animals and what they would do and they did exactly that to the women -young girls- and even have raped men. They should never be allowed out of their sand boxes.
1:ChucklesM That just isn't going to work. How many different languages do German women need to learn to say "no" in? I'd assume Arabic would be a key one.
1:GoReaganGo @ChucklesM hot high speed lead is an international language
0:holygrailer @GoReaganGo @ChucklesM They should allow the German women weapons to protect themselves.
0:ChucklesM Or......fathers, brothers, cousins of the women should protect them. How about that?
0:Artitu @ChucklesM Sounds like Islam...a woman cannot leave her house unless accompanied by a male relative.
1:ChucklesM Then let them get raped. I don't really care. Go near one of the women in my family though. Different story.
0:retiredhal @Artitu @ChucklesM If in an Islamic country the raped woman is considered to have dishonored her family and subject to beatings by her family if not subjected to an "honor killing".
0:holygrailer @ChucklesM Add to that....if they do protect the women--there should be no prosecution for them for what they do to these scumbags.
1:AlexanderHamilton76 Saying "no" does not stop rapists. Keeping droves of men with "raping" mentality out of the country and arming people for self defense will help curb the rapes.

0:46and2 "On Thursday, a local court in Cologne handed down the first conviction for a sexual offense on New Year's Eve. A 21-year-old Iraqi man was convicted of sexual assault and given a one-year suspended sentence. A 26-year-old Algerian man was convicted of abetting a sexual assault and attempted assault, and given the same sentence." That is some aggressive sentencing there, I am absolutely certain that will deter such behavior from them in the future.
1:GoReaganGo @46and2 This would be a very reasonable sentence if it had one caveat, namely, boiling these subhuman scumbags in pig blood.

0:Andrew917 Transgender people have existed since the beginning of time. Some have just always kept the fact that they felt they were the wrong gender a secret and suffered in silence. Others actually lived as the other gender often after moving to a new location. Obviously they used the bathroom of the gender they were living as and no one knew, because unlike Christian Conservatives they didn't go into bathrooms or dressing areas flailing their gen italia around. But now that it's 2016, all of a sudden it's a problem. Why? Politics. And the awareness that these people exist.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 but CHRISTIANS are the only reason why you care about gays or tgs you want them in all of our churches . of have us pay a huge fine right? that is your equal rights
0:SB117 @wayne230 @Andrew917 Think for yourself for once.

0:Andrew917 @wayne230 @Andrew917 Republicans en masse are getting ready to turn their back on Trump the way they did on Bob Dole in '96 when it was clear he couldn't win against Bill Clinton.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 no the opposite your polls poll mostly Democrats who can't stand Hilary who matters because of that cigar
0:Andrew917 @wayne230 @Andrew917 The polls are accurate Wayne. Pollsters compete with each other for contracts and as a result focus on accuracy. They have no problem predicting elections within the margin of error. A couple like Fox and Rasmussen have a Republican house effect of around 3 points. A couple like PPP have a Dem house effect of around 3. The polls say Trump isn't doing very well. Worse than they said McCain and Romney were doing at this same time. EVEN Fox's polls.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 why does that Neke Silver say that Trump will win by 57 percent?? they can easily find Democrats in Manhattans. but they don't like Hilary at all not many do

0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg Source?
0:Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg They dumped Carter because he couldn't resolve the hostage crisis and inflation was out of control...after he was in office four years. Now why are they going to dump Hillary?

0:wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @ProfessorHeisenberg nope a VOTE for hilary is what your only answer would be
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @ProfessorHeisenberg No, any answer to the question would be a fine answer.
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg nope because the Dems rejected Carter and will do the same to Hilary. they want no more four years of Monica Lewinski
1:Andrew917 @wayne230 @Andrew917 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg Monica Lewinski lol.
0:wayne230 @Andrew917 @wayne230 @SB117 @ProfessorHeisenberg why not? she is why Hilary matters

0:SB117 @AlienNation @wayne230 Don't hold your breath.
0:AlienNation @SB117 @AlienNation @wayne230Freedomscout just replied to me below. Read it if you dare. It's so sad.
1:SB117 @AlienNation @SB117 @wayne230 I don't bother reading his posts. Everything coming from a creationist is nonsense.
0:SB117 @wayne230 @AlienNation I wonder which of your favorite talking heads just said that on TV.
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
1:freedomscout The ones harmed the most are the children who are taught in government schooling that "transgenderism" is a valid description of a true reality. First, the very fact that "transgenderism" is not a true reality in itself but a condition of mind makes the claim of validity false...thus being deceptive for the children, youth, adolescents and adults who are deceived by it. Deception about anything critically important in the learning, growth, self-understanding and self-appreciation, and view of the civil society is evil and must be refused and refuted. To confuse children and youth, especially on the issues of their own nature is inexcusable and abusive to them. Because the falsehoods regarding "transgenderism" are being foisted on the culture by intention and willing complicity, the evil effects are widespread and become repeated in social media of all kinds.The result for stability of family and civil society is degradation of both.
0:MollyPitcher1776 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer Seriously, your denial of transgenderism as a "real thing" is quite dangerous as is the condemnation of anyone who is struggli g with identity issues because they are born that way or develop differently due to hormones and biology.
1:Freedomscout @MollyPitcher1776 Transgenderism is just that, an "ism", meaning it is a condition of mind not based on reality. So when I say "real thing" I'm referring to the reality that such a person is confused because they think in their minds they are something which they are not in reality. Condemnation of such confused people isn't appropriate though either, precisely because they are confused and their inner motivations which bring on that confusion are something they don't understand themselves.
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer "Trangenderism" is real. Does it mean someone's gender has actually changed? No, but that doesn't make it less real. You mention evil effects. What are they? Be specific, not just something like it's evil or wrong.
1:freedomscout @mdr1975 To call some confusion of mind "real" distorts the discussion, as I tried to make clear that the confusion phenomena is real, i.e. that the person is really confused. So what is real is in opposition to what the confused person believes is real. When I refer to "evil" effects, I'm not using the term generically very often but to indicate a moral form of something that is inherently evil. However, I suspect you are looking for the human consequences that are harmful to the subject (victim) and to families and civil society. Is that the case?
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @mdr1975 Either way. Yes, how does it harm the individual and society? And, generically, what makes it inherently evil?
0:freedomscout @mdr1975 The harm to the person who is confused about their own sexuality should be obvious, but sadly political correctness has suppressed much of the truth about it. On the face of it, it's inherently harmful for a person to be confused about anything where reality is involved, because the confusion causes them to react to reality erroneously, making decisions that are, at least, not in their best interest and that are, at worst, very harmful to their lives and wellbeing.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @mdr1975 How will you go about "curing" them? They have tried many different kinds of therapy with them. The only best solution for now is to help them transition. Forcing them to be "normal" will have them end up in depression, various problems and possibly suicide.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @mdr1975 Also they are not "confused" as they are well aware of their own bodies.
1:freedomscout @AlienNation There is a common misconception that one can somehow "force" a confused person out of their confusion. That seldom works, although there are some conditions where various forms of coercion may be effective...and may raise ethical concerns.Transgenderism, like all of the other sexual confusions and perversions, is inherently depressive to the individual, with other inner self harmful effects also...sometimes resulting in suicide. These are all very sad effects and consequences...and need core inner remedies not pandering, sheltering or accommodating. These confusions and perversions are inherently mental, not sourced in the physical nature itself...speaking generally and referring to the great majority of cases. The problem with most of psychology is that it categorizes "mental" as physical, of the brain, instead of the "mind". That's why secular psychology has no answers for these conditions, as permanent correction of the core cause. However, well versed psychologists and counselors who understand the mind as being part of the core spirit nature of the human being, human person, treat the person very differently, with an understanding of volition which dynamically changes the process of treatment and dynamically results in core therapy and lasting benefit, true healing of the person to live normally as they truly are in harmony with their physical self.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @AlienNation Again you have not given any viable solution. The "spiritual counseling" have been done many times before. The depression comes from the fact that people like you will not accept them as who they are and instead want to force them to conform to what is your idea of reality.
1:Freedomscout @AlienNation The depression doesn't come from outside for these persons, but from their inner confusion about their own nature and value. It can be accentuated by outside influence that is demeaning, of course. But the depression source is internal to the person themselves, and is alleviated when they come to understand some core concepts about their nature as human persons as well as their physical nature. I suppose that what you conceive as "spiritual counselling" is simplistic recitation of Scripture and platitudes, along with sessions of prayer, etc. What I'm actually referring to is very deep counseling, working inward from the objective self-concepts of the person as God's created being of immense worth and value, to both God and the rest of humanity. But the subject does not easily acclimate to these concepts when they are so confused. It takes a great deal of patience and explanation on various levels of understanding that fit the subject's own initial perceptions and beliefs, helping them to understand where they are in error in their concepts and understanding...and why their understanding is erroneous. Essential in this process is the understanding imparted to the subject that they can choose to believe differently, and choose to redirect their own thinking patterns, actually modifying their brain structure over time. The resulting symbiosis between purposed thought and changes in the brain result in true long lasting, permanent, healing.
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @mdr1975 Seems like general statements again. What is so obviously wrong or evil about it. What actual harm is being caused by their choices?
0:AlienNation "Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last." - Luke 13:30 Guess who will be last in heaven?
0:mdr1975 @AlienNation No one?
0:AlienNation @mdr1975 @AlienNation No one as in nobody is answering or no one as in nobody is going to be last in heaven despite what Jesus said?
0:mdr1975 @AlienNation @mdr1975 No one, as in my guess is no one.
0:MollyPitcher1776 @AlienNation I will be last if you just need someone to close up shop. Does room service exist in Heavan? I hope it is a fun place and not just a bunch of religious nuts praying and such.
0:Freedomscout @MollyPitcher1776 Oh it's going to be a fun place all right. So, as Jesus said earlier in this chapter, " “Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to."
0:Andrew917 @rxwhitmer So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?
1:freedomscout Here we see a rationale commonly used by those who support these bizarre behaviors and policies. First, the terms "discriminate" and "discrimination" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony, as though they were ultimate weapons of warfare against those who oppose these foolish notions. The idea is to intimidate the opposition with these terms to make them feel guilty of some wrong or evil, or at least make them feel unaccepted for who they are in their politically incorrect belief. Then these supporters of fallacy use a blatant fallacy to try to further intimidate any opposition...as in this case making the outrageously fallacious claim, "science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate". This is supposed intimidate the realists by putting them on the defensive, as though it was their job to refute the grand fallacy, instead of the promoter of the fallacy's job to defend it. Then, the tactic includes a question, which is supposed to imply that the writer is open minded rather than dogmatic and doctrinaire, which they are. Also the question is usually very open ended so that the answer will not like refute anything the writer has claimed, thus diverting attention from the utter fallacy and attempted intimidation to "put the monkey" on the back of the opposition. The way to refute these tactics is to speak the truth, even if it is simply put without a lot of facts and figures and arguments...the simple truth. Of course, one can also engage in presentation of facts, figures and arguments which help other readers/listeners learn the deeper proofs for the truth. So, the truth here is that it is righteous to discriminate between righteousness and evil, right and wrong, good and bad, and tell the truth about it. And the truth is that sexual confusions and perversions are a great harm to their subjects and our civil society if tolerated instead of dealt with properly with the Loving Righteousness of God.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @rxwhitmer How will it harm our "civil society"? Be specific, now.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @rxwhitmer Did you not understand the question?
0:mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I agree that people should use the public bathroom that fits their actual gender, but what harm to society is caused by someone being transgender?
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I think he's stumped on that one.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 @freedomscout @rxwhitmer Seems so.
0:AlienNation @freedomscout @rxwhitmer First, the terms "discriminate" and "discrimination" are elevated in their minds to the level of a religious sanctimony – Freedomscout "Indeed there are those who are last who will be first, and first who will be last." - Luke 13:30 "Do to others as you would have them do to you." - Luke 6:31 Freedomscout, you need to heed to Jesus' words about how you treat other people.
0:MollyPitcher1776 @AlienNation @freedomscout @rxwhitmer I try to live by that "Do unto others" bit.
1:wayne230 @MollyPitcher1776 @AlienNation @freedomscout @rxwhitmer which "other people?" that has a hidden meaning and means HOMOSEXUALS. we see that the left faith ISLAM never had to be kind to "others" in Orlando did they? it depends a LOT on the religion. we watched while 102 "others" got shot in a bar yet we get sued over a cake! that VERY selective morality would make Jesus angry.
1:rxwhitmer Of all the sick moves Obama has made, this has to be the top! He seems to think that as president, the people MUST sereve HIM, not that he should be serving the PEOPLE. The only people he seems to feel obligated to serve are those without morals, which he apparently feels he is part of! Even though he only has a few months left in his term, the house and senate should be calling themselves back into session and impeaching him! Under Obama and Clinton this country has become an immoral, dirtier than dirt nation! I suggest he send his children to a public school affected by this despotic rule! Just to show us how much he believes it!
0:Andrew917 @rxwhitmer So you think it's moral to discriminate against transgender people when science, medicine and psychology all say their condition is legitimate? On what basis?
1:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer So you think it is fine to protect the rights of immoral people while taking the rights from innocent women to have their privacy?
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmerImmoral people? Who?
1:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmerTransgender that is who.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer If you don't understand what transgender is, go talk to your family doctor. They cover it in medical school.
1:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer I understand completely who they are. You are the one that has bought into the lie that they were born with some genetic defect. Transgender is a sick perversion.
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Transgenders are immoral? That's news to me. I personally know two and they're not immoral.
0:lgrngreen @LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Like your morals don't fall into question by supporting this.
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Why should they?
1:lgrngreen @LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Simply because people like you are out to change what is considered moral into something that isn't.
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer By whose definition? Yours only?
0:lgrngreen @LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer No by the standard that has been around since this country was founded and before. So I guess you think we should still have sla very? I'm not surprised. It's biblical too.
0:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Nice tactic to switch the conversation.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer I'm just identifying exactly where your so called morals are coming from.
0:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Not hardly.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Oh really? Then where?
0:lgrngreen @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Your interpretation of the Bible is flawed so making you understand anything from it will never happen until you recognize your need for a savior.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer So you admit it. Your morality is coming from the bible and not science or medicine. Thank you for making my point.
0:LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer So his morality is based on what was prevalent in the Middle East about 2000 years ago. Nothing like keeping up to date, eh?
0:Andrew917 @LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer Notice how she took off when it came down to actually having to defend God's Word.
0:LarJass @Andrew917 @LarJass @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer Yep!
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer its where YOURS comes from too the Bible is why you push TG and gays its a lot more than a book
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Deuteronomy 22:28 If a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and r@pes her and they are discovered, 29 he shall pay her father fifty shekels of silver. He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Leviticus 25:44 “‘Your male and female sla ves are to come from the nations around you; from them you may buy sla ves. 45 You may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country, and they will become your property. 46 You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them sla ves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer JEWISH LAWS they don't do that. but you care about the return of slavery via gay marriage
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Exodus 21:20 “Anyone who beats their male or female sla ve with a rod must be punished if the sla ve dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the sla ve recovers after a day or two, since the sla ve is their property.
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer your faith ISLAM is far worse toward slaves than we are
0:LarJass @lgrngreen @Andrew917 @LarJass @rxwhitmer Where do they come from, then?
0:Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Like your morals don't fall into question by getting your info about human se xuality and gender identity from a barbaric ancient middle eastern desert tribe that had no problem with adults marrying children and thought the appropriate way to deal with ra pe was to make the ra pist marry the victim.
0:LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @LarJass @rxwhitmer Or stone the victim.
1:wayne230 @LarJass @Andrew917 @lgrngreen @rxwhitmer like Muslims do already
0:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Discriminate against them in what way?
0:Andrew917 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer By telling them they can't use the bathroom or facilities of the gender that they're living as and under medical and mental health guidance to live as...as they have been for decades.
1:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @mdr1975 @rxwhitmerHaving someone use the bathroom of their actual gender is not discrimination. A man who identifies as a woman (or vice versa) does not mean he is a woman.
0:Andrew917 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Except that that's not their actual gender. They're the gender they're living as.
1:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @mdr1975 @rxwhitmerGender is not a choice. You're born male or female. It doesn't change because you think your the opposite.
0:LarJass @mdr1975 It's "you're," You write like a fifth-grader. And sound like one as well.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 Good job, you caught a typo to point out since you don't have a counter argument.
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @LarJass It wasn't a typo. You don't know the difference.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 That doesn't make sense. If I know the difference between the two words, but used the wrong one, that is a typo. This isn't a college paper, I'm not proofreading or checking for auto correct issues. Again, I notice no counter argument from you on the actual post though.
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @LarJass How can I possibly make an understandable counter argument to someone that doesn't know the difference between "your" and "you're"? I just can't du﻿m﻿b it down enough.
0:mdr1975 @LarJass @mdr1975 And you can't understand a typo. Or just hide behind that claim since you can't argue the point, which is more likely in this case.
0:LarJass @mdr1975 @LarJass Ha ha!!
0:Andrew917 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer Ask your family doctor about it. They'll explain it to you.
1:mdr1975 @Andrew917 @mdr1975 @rxwhitmer It's pretty simple. A woman does not change into a man by thinking it. She is still a woman. No issue with her thinking/acting like a man, but that isn't what she is, physically.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer join Islam SHOOT the TGs/gays problem solved they get to discriminate against whoever they want to
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer ?
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer No answer huh? there is no way you are for equal rights
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer no answer? You didn't ask a question.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer I did make a statement. I admit that
1:wayne230 @Andrew917 @rxwhitmer ITS PERFECTLY OKAY DEPENDING ON THE RELIGION the liberal faith militant Islam gets to shoot all the TG/s gays it wants to and be protected under Sharia Law
1:freedomscout @rxwhitmer While I empathize with the sentiment and agree that Obama's motives are evil, the long standing evil of murderous abortion has been a terrible part of the moral decadence in America for 43 years now. But even that has been a symptom of the inner decay in the lives of so many people who have lost the moral compass that used to guide our culture.
0:freedomscout The added confusion this is all bringing to children, youth, adolescents and young adults is tragic and so unnecessary. Parents are having a very difficult time shielding their children from the foolish influences of our culture that is creating so much uncertainty and relativism in the minds of youth...largely through social media and sadly through government schooling.
0:Andrew917 @freedomscout - The confusion is added by people following an ancient mythology that have no respect for science, medicine and psychology.
0:freedomscout @Andrew917 How does that have anything to do with it?
1:LarJass @freedomscout @Andrew917 Religion poisons the minds of children against logic and truth.
1:freedomscout @LarJass Many religions are poisonous to logic and truth, that much is true...and human beings still remain fallen human beings even they are Redeemed by the Sacrifice of Jesus Christ. So there's that. But the fallacies of thinking cannot be limited or attributed to religion but to error inherent in human motivation, the motivation to utter self-centeredness as fallen sinful human beings. Nearly all of the world's many religions are expressions of that utter sinful nature...Christianity and Judaism being the sole exceptions.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass Your comment was correct...except for the last seven words.
0:freedomscout @LarJass I stand by all of them.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass Sure you do. And you look like a fo﻿ol.
0:freedomscout @LarJass I identify with Paul the Apostle, glad to be called a fool for Jesus Christ.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass You're just a fo﻿ol...period.
1:freedomscout The saddest result, perhaps, of these political machinations is that children will be influenced to doubt what and who they really are as God's Grand Creation with Inestimable Value.
0:LarJass @freedomscout Is that any worse than the nonsense in the bible?
0:freedomscout @LarJass Since there isn't any nonsense in the Bible, these things surely are worse.
0:LarJass @freedomscout @LarJass No nonsense in the bible? That's funny, scouty!!
0:wayne230 @LarJass @freedomscout None at all and you KNOW it or you would not misquote it
0:MollyPitcher1776 @freedomscout I figured it out by age 5. The good thing is children will have access to healthcare, information, medicine, treatment and support. None of which existed for transexuals when I was a little girl growing up in the 1970's and 80's.
1:ProfessorHeisenberg What a sick, Satan possessed world we live in.
0:freedomscout @ProfessorHeisenberg Stand by for it to get much worse.
0:mdr1975 @ProfessorHeisenberg The world is not possessed by satan.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @ProfessorHeisenberg sure it is unless you are on the side of ISIS
1:ProfessorHeisenberg Thankfully Obama is the first and last gay president. Not to mention black.
0:ProfessorHeisenberg Just because Obama wants to pee in the ladies room doesn't mean the rest of America has to put up with it.
0:SB117 That's an odd fantasy.
0:wayne230 @SB117 you want to watch obama pee? YOU are sick
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 What are you talking about?
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 still pushing for yes on TG/gays?
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Again, what are you talking about? Who said they wanted to watch Obama pee? And, who is pushing you to say on TG/gays?
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 you do and so does SB its about FORCED deviance without that no sense would be possible
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 I can't speak for SB, but I don't want to watch anyone pee, nor do I care if you (or anyone else) watches someone else pee.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 fine then lets leave the bathrooms alone
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 When have I said to mess with a bathroom?
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 you asked what I was talking about did you not? which really meant change the bathrooms
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 No, you asked who wants to see Obama pee. I then asked what are you talking about, because no one had said they want to watch him pee.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 I think you do but its about forced perversion or else
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Again, claiming things I've never said
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 nothing EVER is said but pro perversion
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 So, what you say is pro perversion then?
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 why else do you want sense from me? what you need is AGREEMENT with a sick lifestyle SOCIALISMLESS @SB117 for liberals ... that is normal
1:WisdomKitty Could this be the real reason, as to why Ms. Clinton basically stopped wearing dresses and pantyhose? Could she possibly have possessed the wisdom to determine what a high-risk liability it would be, having pantyhose entangled about her ankles, as an unknown man entered the ladies room with her, unbeknownst, or did Mr. Clinton simply forewarn her, as to the potential danger? Will the left seek to ban ladies from wearing pantyhose, next, and maybe even dresses, deeming such to be an unnecessary risk within the ladies room?
0:SB117 @WisdomKitty 0/10
0:Andrew917 @WisdomKitty -1/10
0:wayne230 @WisdomKitty her first move God forbid will be to ban dresses
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKitty Yeah, a real danger that will happen, I'm sure.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittyyou want men wearing dresses not me
0:SB117 You have a very active imagination.
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @WisdomKitty Do I want men wearing dresses? No, but not freaked out by it either.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittyme either but that will be the next drug
0:SB117 You forgot to take yours, clearly...
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @WisdomKittyWhat will be the next drug?
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittytransgenders already is since the court failed to require churches to marry gays
0:SB117 You need a gibberish->English translator to understand any of his posts.
0:mdr1975 @SB117 I do right now because these post aren't making any sense.
0:SB117 As is usually the case with Wayne.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Laugh only a pro gay/TG post would EVER make sense to you stop the no sense lie!
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 No, seriously read your post. It didn't make any sense. Not even talking the opinion it stated. Referring to the phrasing.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 lie you are redefining sense to mean disagreement
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 No, I'm trying to figure out what you are saying. You're asking questions claiming someone wants stuff they haven't mentioned.
1:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 not at all you are desperately pushing for a pro deviant answer from me nothing else can make sense but that.its an old liberal game I see all the time unless I say yes to gay marriage and TG bathrooms I can never make sense to you
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 I just want you to make sense. You're saying stuff like transgenders are the new drug. Be against gays and transgender people all you want, but please make sense when you write so others can understand you.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @SB117 Not at all you want me to agree with gays and TGs or it will be impossible to make sense to you its a tiresome liberal game that can never allow different opinions
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 Another claim of something I've never said. I am fine with you not agreeing with or liking gays or transgenders, and have never said otherwise. People can have different opinions.
0:nonstopca @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKittyMaybe you aren't...but I am....
0:mdr1975 @nonstopca1 @mdr1975 @wayne230 @WisdomKitty Why?
0:rxwhitmer @WisdomKitty Actually, the reason she wears pants suits is to better hide the fact she's wearing depends and they might leak!
0:WisdomKitty @rxwhitmer Such is a plausible hypothesis, and if true, perhaps they are customized with body enhancements; nevertheless, she and her party are attacking women, via the Alinsky playbook.
0:Andrew917 Trans people have always used the bathroom/facilities of the gender they're living as. Conservatives just like discrimination and want to create potentially explosive situations. They seem to thrive on that in fact.
0:SB117 @Andrew917 Really, it's a distraction. Nobody in their right mind would think this was a problem.
0:1Jessie @SB117 @Andrew917 It's not, as long as it's not a law. A law saying that men can be in the ladies room, lets ALL men come in...that means rapists, and pedophiles. I've been in ladies rooms and noticed transgenders...they aren't what scares me...rapists and pedophiles do.
0:SB117 @1Jessie @SB117 @Andrew917 What law is saying that? What in the world are you talking about? All you're doing is confirming my point.
0:Andrew917 @1Jessie @SB117 @Andrew917 All men can already come in the women's bathroom. Most places have no law against that. The people trying to pass laws are the Republicans insisting that people use the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. So what laws are you talking about?
0:SB117 @Andrew917 @1Jessie @SB117 It's the same subset of people that think SCOTUS passed a "law" allowing SSM.
1:wayne230 @SB117 @Andrew917 @1Jessie THERE WERE 102 GAYS SHOT IN ORLANDO OVER THE GAY RULING WHERE WERE THEIR EQUAL RIGHTS?
0:SB117 It was over the ruling? Really? Source?
0:SB117 *crickets
1:wayne230 @SB117 sure all over the news the killer did it because of Sharia Law which is why the media deflected to his weapon. that showed what a LIE equal rights is
0:SB117 So, no source on your claim. Ok then.
0:rxwhitmer @Andrew917 NO they haven't and they'd better not. Not that I'd do anything about it, but there are a whole lot of people who would! Obama or no Obama. His legacy apparently is to be the President who has went against the will of the people who elected him more than anyone before him!
0:TurnHearts Has anyone heard if Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and other celebrities and corporations who condemned/boycotted NC are going to do the same to these other states? All I have heard is ..... crickets... Come on, where is the equality in your outrage, liberals? I can't hear you!
0:dusty911 @TurnHearts They haven't passed their Jim Crow laws yet.
1:wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts You want slavery BACK that is why you want forced perversion you are calling that equality
0:SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts What forced perversion?
1:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts which you push like mad I get so sick of the lie called equal rights
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts You didn't answer the question. What forced per⁠version? If you're sick of the nons⁠ense you make up, stop saying it.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts you never ASKED one you are making a statement and want compliance
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts For the third time; what forced perversion?
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts and answer not desired
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts I didn't think so. All you know is the talking point on its face; you can't ever defend it.
0:wayne230 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Your only point is forced compliance of perversion
0:SB117 @wayne230 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Fourth time; What forced compliance of perversion?
0:mdr1975 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Don't expect an answer to your question. I doubt you'll get one from him.
0:SB117 @mdr1975 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts I don't expect one. I'm hoping that he'll eventually realize he's a c⁠o⁠w⁠ard and s⁠h⁠u⁠t up.
0:wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 @wayne230 @dusty911 @TurnHearts because you are demanding COMPLIANCE or fines that is the only "answer" you will bother with
0:SB117 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts Fines for what?
0:mdr1975 @wayne230 @mdr1975 @SB117 @dusty911 @TurnHearts I'm just pointing out that you haven't answered the first 3 times the question was asked, so don't expect an answer on the 4th time.
0:SB117 @TurnHearts Who cares?
0:MollyPitcher1776 @TurnHearts Thats awsome! I hope the boycott ruins that states finances and the current AG becomes NCs next Govener.
1:wayne230 @MollyPitcher1776 @TurnHearts yep and your own kids will get raped by a pedophile in a shared bathroom then YOU will be crying. or will you? women have bodies in bedrooms but not bathrooms!
0:Tenniscourtoath @TurnHearts NC made itself the poster boy for this repulsive legislation which is why they are being singled out. Where is the conservative outage over Dennis Hastert, Mark Foley and Larry Craig?
0:anniekaye @Tenniscourtoath @TurnHearts There was outrage over it. Didn't all of those men go to jail for their crimes? Has nothing to do with allowing someone to go into any bathroom of their choice.
0:rxwhitmer @TurnHearts These are celebrities? They are monkeys howlling at the moon! North Carolina has the right to make laws for their own state. Obama does NOT, and neither do any of your so called celebrities! What you and many others forget is that the United States of America is a collection of dependent states having their own morals and laws. Obama thinks that President means KING. It doesn't. It means limited leader. There are many things he cannot legally do, and this happens to be one of them!
0:DanielMaclean If states can ignore real federal laws and allow people to consume controlled substances for recreational usage, states can ignore imaginary federal laws and keep moving forward in a sane and rational way.
0:ch4101 @DanielMaclean I was thinking the same thing. Couldn't these states sue and claim why are some cities and states ignoring federal immigration laws
0:killterrists Indeed, everywhere one looks into Obama’s background, we find sealed records, scrubbed websites, altered documents, deception and unanswered questions. Can anyone imagine for a second if John McCain or George Bush had blocked access to his school, medical, and birth records? It would have been headlines in their case, but as with everything else concerning Obama, the media has given him a pass on this. Of all these marvels, the latest mystery and probably most perplexing is that of Obama’s social security number. It appears that Obama has multiple identities in term of possessing numerous social security numbers. Orly Taitz, an attorney who has filed numerous suits against Obama regarding his eligibility to serve as president, appears to have been the first to discover this. In her suit, representing a number of military officers who are refusing to serve under an ineligible commander in chief, she hired private investigator Neil Sankey to conduct research on Obama’s prior addresses and Social Society numbers. Using Intelius, Lexis Nexis, Choice Point and other public records, Sankey found around 25 Social Security numbers connected with Obama’s name. However, it may not be as many as 25, since Sankey also searched using closely related names such as: “Barak Obama,” “Batock Obama,” “Barok Obama,” and “Barrack Obama.” There may very well be some Kenyans living in America with the same last name and a similar first name. In any case, I will exclude these records for the purpose of this research and focus only on names spelled exactly like his name. Moreover, we can verify many of the Social Security numbers as valid since they’re connected to addresses at which we know Obama resided. Needless to say, there are also a slew of address and social security numbers connected to addresses in states that Obama has no known connection to. In Obama’s home state, Illinois, Sankey tracked down 16 different addresses for a Barack Obama or a Barack H. Obama, of which all are addresses he was known to have lived at. Two Social Security numbers appear for these addresses, one beginning with 042 and one starting 364. In California, where Obama attended Occidental College, there are six addresses listed for him, all within easy driving distance of the college. However, there are three Social Security numbers connected to these addresses, 537 and two others, each beginning with 999. There are no addresses listed in New York where he attended Columbia University, but there is one listed for him in nearby Jackson, NJ, with a Social Security number beginning with 485.
1:steveinarizona @killterrists He did like millions of Mexicans and other illegals have done. Used a dead person number or made up a number. Some even use their children number if they were born in the U.S. A fake social security card in Phoenix runs about $100
0:killterrists 713 Hart Senate Office Building In Massachusetts – where Obama attended Harvard Law School – we find three addresses, all using the 042 Social Security number. After Obama was elected to the United States Senate in 2005, he moved into an apartment at 300 Massachusetts Ave NW; the Social Security number attached to that address is the 042 one. Yet, three years later, Obama used a different Social Security number for an address listed as: 713 Hart Senate Office Building. This was the address of his United States Senate office. This Social Security number began with 282 and was verified by the government in 2008. This mystery grows even stranger as other addresses and Social Security numbers for Barack Obama appear in a dozen other states not known to be connected to him. Again, I am excluding those records names not spelled exactly like his name. * Tennessee, one address with a Social Security number beginning with 427 * Colorado, one address, with a Social Security number beginning with 456. * Utah, two addresses, with two Social Security numbers beginning with 901 and 799. * Missouri has one address and one Social Security number beginning with 999. * Florida has two addresses listed for his him, three if you count one listed as “Barry Obama.” One is connected to a Social Security number beginning with 762. * In Georgia there are three addresses listed for him, all with different Social Security numbers: 579, 420, and 423. * In Texas there are four different addresses listed for him, one is connected to Social Security number 675. * There are two addresses listed for Barack Obama in Oregon and one address listed for him in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania. All told, there are 49 addresses and 16 different Social Security numbers listed for a person whose name is spelled “Barack Obama.” In some cases, the middle initial “H” is listed. If you were to expand the search to include closely related names such as: “Barac,” “Barak,” and “Barrack” Obama, you would find more than a dozen additional addresses and Social Security numbers. Finally, the one Social Security number Obama most frequently used, the one beginning with 042, is a number issued in Connecticut sometime during 1976-1977, yet there is no record of Obama ever living or working in Connecticut. Indeed, during this time period Obama would have been 15-16 years old and living in Hawaii at the time. Ann, Stanley and Madelyn Dunham

1:Meow6680 Obama does not want illegal criminals deported, PERIOD! One of his reason is because his uncle would then be deported instead of being given a free pass to commit more crimes. His uncle is protected, ICE has been ORDERED to stay away from him, and local law enforcement has been told they are not to arrest him or harass him anymore. Look it up, this is true.

0:cr_44 Should be a bounty for civilians who apprehend and turn over illegals to ICE. They say they have to few agents, this would hugely expand the forces on the street. Of course, there needs to be total E-verify compliance enforced to prevent undocumented people from holding jobs. If we want to enforce our immigration laws we can, but the facts are we as a society do not have the political will to do so. I suspect in 50 years the U.S.A. as a true s,overeign nation will have been so diluted as to not exist.

0:firstonewild Sanctuary is a function of the Catholic Church. States are not suppose to impose their Religion over the citizens of the US. The people under Sanctuary are suppose to be housed and remain on Church Grounds. At the expense of the Church. Until a determination of resolve between the State and Church can be made concerning the individual. An individual that leaves the Church grounds is subject to the full extent of the Law. The State is liable for the damages caused by the imposing of the Catholic Religion on the people.
1:OldSSage @firstonewild When the blatant anti- Christian asault by the Administration and Democrats at every level is ceased then some credence can be accorded to the "sanctuary" argument. SANCTUARY cities are run by virulent secularists and Liberals. They are a recruiting ground for ILLEGAL voters and a means to bolster the population for districting purposes. Sadly the American catholic Church is only afactor when some Liberal tenet can be contrived, If the Catholic Church had any real clout every legislator,Pelosi and Biden comes to mind,purporting to be a Catholic and being supporters of any and all legislation supporting abortion and taxpayers paying for it would be publicly excommunicated. That has not happened and the Catholic Church is no longer the bastion of morals that could once influence elections. Sanctuary Cities are the creation of Liberals looking for support from legal minorities. RELIGIONhas nothing to do with it unless you are an amoral athiest...
0:pkinsolomons I think cutting off federal funds to cities who do not enforce current law is a dandy idea. Nothing would make them move faster to fix that sanctuary attitude of aiding and abeting illegals in the commission of a crime - staying here illegally, working here using false papers (fraud) or worse.
0:firstonewild @pkinsolomons Sanctuary Is a place of refuge for Individuals that are appealing to the people of a State and not the State itself. A plea for personal protection in full recognition of their gilt in the breaking of the laws of a State. A safe zone of apprehension by the People for the protection of all. Where they can safely present their case of circumstances that led them to having no other alternative than to brake the States Laws. For when a State itself is involved in the granting of Sanctuary it is in conflict of interest to itself and the people thereof.

So they had what they called "Day without a Mexican" where they all stayed home from work in protest. Totally backfired on them. There was no traffic on the freeways (unheard of in LA), all the businesses functioned without issue, and all the white people asked when they were gonna have another one.

1:Pilgrim1620 Jeh Johnson is another political hack. Here in Arizona we are flooded with illegal immigrant criminals and the only law enforcement agency to take action, Sheriff Joe Arpaio's Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, has been stopped from his program to weed out these felons. It seems to me that it would benefit the supporters of Mexican and Central American immigration to remove the felons from their neighborhoods but that doesn't appear to be the case. Congress needs to pass a bill to stop federal funding for sanctuary cities NOW! It's interesting that liberals want more federal power but when it comes to issues like this they spout about LOCAL control. We cannot afford any more illegals. We need to get our own house in order before we go back to saving the world!

0:DAlnB41 @JNY My entire family including me, my wife, my kids and grandkids entire wardrobes could not be valued at $20,000.00- the amount the Obama girls paid for their individual party dresses. Many in America are "waking up" and are fed up with a government that works harder at seeing the wealthy get theirs while tens of millions of American men and women are out of work, while many who were at one time productive workers with homes for their families, families who participated in community and school activities and were working to achieve the American Dream has been pushed aside to allow immigrants, legal and illegal, to come here and work! Obama and his administration has turned their backs on the American people and America! Obama is quick to point our how many new jobs were created in America but ; he never points out how many were lost, how many of the jobs filled were filled with immigrant workers (his own Labor Department says 3 out of four jobs in America is being taken by immigrants (legal and illegal) or how many men and women who at one time had jobs have run out of unemployment benefits, can not get work and are no longer counted in the "Official" Unemployment numbers. He does not point out the massive, huge, and growing national debt that the nation has grown under his administration. Could it be Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton was done so history will have someone else to show as the worst president in our history? She has one of American politics worst personal records already; electing her president will end in disaster and Obama will no longer have to face the reputation of Americas Greatest Presidential failure and the books showing him as the worst president in our history! confussed "He's a fraud" "He's a thin skinned Fake" What lets delete that!

0:MyOwnWoman Here's the thing, for me, on immigration. It's like having company at your home. Guests arrive at your front door, they knock, you let them in. Maybe you offer them a beverage, have a nice chat. If those same people broke into your home, damaged your home, and treated you like garbage, you would defend your home. You would not invite them back. For over 200 years, we have had guests come to our American front door. We've invited them in, helped them get settled, made them part of our great American Family. That's who we are. But the criminals who insist on breaking down the back door to get in illegally, and then expect the rest of us to just say it's OK, are just not welcome. Go to the front door, knock, and we'll let you in. Otherwise, go home.

0:puliy Obama did not show any dignity when he was the commencement speaker at the Rutgers University in NJ: such guests are traditionally eminent citizens and are expected to tell the new graduates to work hard, with sincerity and integrity in their jobs in order to have a successful career. Instead, he took the opportunity to criticize and attack Trump. The first lady is doing the same thing now at another commencement proving that their meanness has only worsened after nearly eight years in the highest and most powerful office of the nation. What a shame and tragedy?
0:johnsellers It seems that you and some others prefer to give graduates fluff instead of what is actually going on.

0:OSYM She gives a commencement speech at a college that has a 9.6% 4 year graduation rate. Well done.
0:rdennisuk @OSYM I think that is probably one more commencement speech than you have given
0:Joe Methuen @rdennisuk @OSYM OSYM's comment is relevant. Yours is not.
0:brando5 @rdennisuk @OSYM and 1 more then you have ever heard
1:harrisonzayre @OSYM Well, you have to understand that black students can't be expected to understand things about American culture. Because they are from Africa and they don't speak the language. Also, slavery has kept them down, has shut them out, and has left them wholly unable to compete with others in society. And if you're buying this, be sure and let me know how to contact you so that I can show you some prime oceanfront property that I have available on the cheap in downtown Memphis Tennessee. You can have your choice of Atlantic or Pacific Ocean.
0:sk5360 @harrisonzayre @OSYM dont forget the 20 TRILLION DOLLARS SPENT ON THE SOCIAL PROGRAMS ,SUPPOSE TO HELP THE DOWNTRODDEN BUT WENT TO LINE THE POCKET OF THOSE IN WASHINGTON.
0:Kenneth851 The reason Trump supporters have such anger is the result of Michells husband..
0:suesman @Kenneth851 How much does the U.S. owe China ? That's HIS results. I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you.
0:brando5 @suesman @Kenneth851 4 Trillion, not including 300,000 Million in interest per year..
1:Duckyy No, get it right. It's not Michelle, but in reality MICHAEL Obama. She is a he.
1:marco @Duckyy Is that the reason buckwheat pass the lgbt bill with the help of the other gay scotus for his dude.
1:puliy @Duckyy So the transgender bathroom idea came to Obama from "experience" at home?
1:harrisonzayre @puliy @Duckyy When you don't know whether to stand or sit then you might not know where to take a… Dump!

0:Tpartypatriot101 There are simple facts that most normal people do not wake up every morning remembering. I am Slavic; I don't wake up every morning realizing my predecessors were slaves. This was perhaps one of the most divisive statements she has uttered, especially after 7 1/2 years of opportunities to make hope and change. Obama and Michelle have been utter failures, now leaving this Country in worldwide disarray with multiple enemies on several new fronts!

0:MarshallGibson I wonder if Egyptian Africans wake up everyday obsessed by the fact that Hebrew slaves built the Pyramids?? Somebody should stage some protests over there. Throw some eggs, maybe. Maybe Israel can press Egypt for reparations. It's only been about 4 thousand years.
0:rabcor @MarshallGibson No. They will protest commemorating the Jews leaving Egypt.
1:MarshallGibson @rabcor @MarshallGibson I don't know why the Obummers aren't all over that one. You know, being 'African' and all.
1:dawndale If she doesn't like living in a house "built by slaves" then she should move out. The hypocrisy that fills the life of Obama and his wife is too great for either of them to throw darts at anyone else. Does she allow their daughters to use the same bathroom as the males use? Of course not, and not just because they are daughters of the president. She would not allow it but they don't care about the daughters of families. If Mrs. Obama was smart, she would stop pointing fingers at others.
0:dt63944 @dawndale Then she'll be pointing fingers at everyone for a very long time.

0:PurelyRational @elfonshelf Oh, no need to apologize. But you started this, after all. You made the comment, so it's up to you to support it. This was covered in 8th grade debate class. Anything else I can help you with today?

0:mikekley @buffaloguy Good comment!
0:Digger70chall @buffaloguy you'll notice Fox didn't bother to mention the earlier ceremony the same day in Camp Pendleton naming a ship after MoH John Basilone (second ship named after him and it's a real warship DDG) Guess that wouldn't play into the narrative though huh?
0:puleeze Will they make a backdoor deal to get it commissioned?
1:MortisDei I don't understand. Isn't the Navy gay enough already?
0:daisman Pathetic! If I was in the Navy when the ship comes out, I'd refuse to serve on it! This guy was no military anything, never served! Not a key United States government person, just a local nobody! Pathetic!
0:mikekley @daisman He served in the Navy for 4 years, but was forced out with an "Other than honorable" discharge. Shouldn't we be naming ships after people who received an honorable discharge at the very minimum??
1:turtletank So, it's a ship that oils up other ships and hauls away their effluence? I guess, if you have politicians this determined to name a ship after a rumpranger an oiler is the best option.

1:Unidentified743 Welp, I guess this is the end of the US Navy as history has known it previously. It used to be a place where young boys went to learn how to be men. Now I guess it's a place where young gay boys go to meet other young gay boys. We must be a laughing stock.
0:Tygher @Unidentified743 I don't know about "we," but I'll agree that you're a laughing stock.
0:SamPatch @Unidentified743 Its still the same Navy. Stop being a drama queen.
1:Anthonyhantonh Did the Village people sing at the naming. LOL What a joke.
0:MrBungle1 @anthonyhantonh Yeah that was a big black eye for the Navy when the Village People filmed a homoerotic video on one of their destroyers.
0:WiltonManors Nothing like a good gay article to bring out the "conservative" dinosaurs. The beauty is - conservatives lost. On gay rights, on your candidates, on everything that counts. Because extremist conservatives are a hate fringe group. Nothing more.

1:my_thoughts As a Navy Veteran I find this deplorable! What happened to the U.C.M.J. that we were held accountable too? I guess when Bill Clinton came in office and implemented "Don't Tell, Don't Ask" any thing that had to do with homosexuality or beastity went out the window. And now with Obama in office ANYTHING goes. Our once great Country has turned into a cesspool of Liberals.

0:TheImmortalOne To all the lying liberals who keep saying he was Honorably discharged. Britannica.com/biography/Harvey-Milk Not according to Harvey he wasn't.
0:SamPatch @TheImmortalOne And military records don't support his claim. Like any politician he was pandering for sympathy and votes.
0:IndictHillary Sorry, Navy, but this is just wrong! There must be numerous homosexuals who have served our country with distinction and not been given a "less than honorable" discharge. The ship could have been named after one of them.
1:dinsmo81 @IndictHillary Or at least ones that didn't openly brag about their pedophilia exploits
0:SamPatch @IndictHillary He was honorably discharged. Go to the United States Naval Institute site and read for yourself.
0:IndictHillary @SamPatch @IndictHillary I will. So, you are saying the the AP is incorrect on that.
0:SamPatch @IndictHillary @SamPatch Yes I am. Have fun.
0:IndictHillary @SamPatch @IndictHillary Interestingly, I find both comments on various site. Honorably and less than honorable. I will hope that the Navy has better presence of mind than naming a ship after someone with a "less than"
0:IndictHillary @SamPatch @IndictHillary That is indeed what the article on the USNI web says. It is not unusual for the AP to be wrong... but usually it favors causes such as this. But, if he was indeed honorably discharged, I apologize to him and withdraw my objection to the ship naming.
0:SamPatch @IndictHillary @SamPatch I really wish there was more info on his Discharge Type as that has fueled a lot of derisive comments, but I have to default with USNI as they are pretty good with getting it right. They also provide info on the article's author at the bottom. Now all that aside, the Navy could have chosen a different vessel than an oiler. The jokes from that will be going around for decades.
0:truthishere @SamPatch @IndictHillary after you pay the $40 to access it I will
0:SamPatch @truthishere @SamPatch @IndictHillaryWhat are you talking about?
0:humbled This is what happens when you politicize the military and make a social experiment out of it.
0:WiltonManors The comments below (and above) are exactly WHY it is appropriate to name the ship after someone who stood up for civil and human rights.
1:dinsmo81 @WiltonManors And by stood up, you mean kneel in front of a 13 year old boy...
1:hawk0323 @dinsmo81 @WiltonManors Or behind...
0:WiltonManors @dinsmo81 @WiltonManors Ever heard of the republican icon Mark Foley?
0:dinsmo81 @WiltonManors @dinsmo81 No, did someone name a boat after him?
0:WiltonManors @dinsmo81 @WiltonManors Try bobbling him and asking. You are the expert on pedophiles (experience counts).
1:hawk0323 @WiltonManors @dinsmo81 Short answer is, No. They didn't name a boat after him like they are doing for this pedophile.
0:IndictHillary @WiltonManors But who was given a "less than honorable" discharge from the very Navy who is naming the ship after him. I guess THAT doesn't count
0:humbled @WiltonManors I don't disagree with your point of view about the comments, but I can tell you this. If we had people at the top who understood the military because they had served, or had other alliances with it, we would not have such controversial issues.
0:dinsmo81 Our Commander in Chief is on the record as supporting and honoring known pedophiles. When will people say enough already?
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 Your obsession with pedophilia tells me you are a pedophile. Please seek help for your sickness.
0:hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Please stick to your day job.........babysitting your mom's basement.
0:Tygher @hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 I get it, you can't defend your pedophilia, so you're lashing out. Get help.
0:hawk0323 @Tygher @hawk0323 @dinsmo81 You giving out a psychological diagnosis and/or advice is the equivalent of a monkey solving a puzzle for a banana.
0:Tygher @hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Did you enjoy the banana?
0:hawk0323 @Tygher @hawk0323 @dinsmo81 Were you trying to make a gay reference? Or call me a monkey....in which case, you were, AGAIN using my post to try and attack. You really are incapable of coming up with any original thought..
0:Tygher @hawk0323 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Are you really so dense you couldn't figure out what I was saying? I doubt you even got the banana. Poor sad thing!
0:dinsmo81 @Tygher @dinsmo81 So demonizing pedophilia is worse than naming naval ships after a known pedophile? Please explain
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 @Tygher Another one who is obsessed with pedophilia. Keep your kids away from @dinsmo81. Sick and dangerous.
0:Windvane60 @Tygher @dinsmo81 Well,your mental identity is very much open to question,given your postings;right ?
0:dinsmo81 What kind of Commander in Chief would allow this to happen?
1:IndictHillary @dinsmo81 I love rhetorical questions. We all know what kind
0:IndictHillary "Milk's career as a Navy officer, however, ended with an "other than honorable" discharge," Yup! That's the kind of person we should be naming ships after. And my comment has nothing to do with his preferences, just his performance as a Navy officer. But apparently his preferences have more to do with a ship being named after him than his performance.... as far as the Navy is concerned.
1:GOTRUMPFORAMERICA As a Navy Veteran, I hope that they painted a target on the hull....
0:Justasouthernguy @GOTRUMPFORAMERICA If you were a Veteran you would not say that. Why would you want a bunch of kids put in harms way that had no say in the matter?
0:hawk0323 @Justasouthernguy @GOTRUMPFORAMERICAWell, technically, they do. They just may not be in the military anymore if they speak out.
1:my_thoughts @Justasouthernguy @GOTRUMPFORAMERICA If you were a Navy Veteran you would understand what GOTRUMPFORAMERICA means by his comments. Naming a ship after a gay that was discharged under other than honorable conditions shows how sick our government and country is.

1:rivrrodent @DMS6922 wellsaid
1:dankat2 I am truly scared of this country now. What have we become? I am not doubting this person may be seen as a person to be recognized for his contribution in history but to name a US Navel Ship this is insane. This country would rather name a ship after a gay right activist then a person of the military maybe a person who died defended America. I am sorry but this is just wrong. It is not the place for reconnection. I don't have an issue with gay's as my grandson is gay but I refuse for them to have more clout then everyone else. A person who is gay should not define them. I think it is respectful to recognize that many have differences but not to award these differences as a power tool. Maybe they should name a ship after my husband who spent 7 1/2 years in the US Navy from 1960-1967.
0:Catmando2015 @dankat2 How does naming a ship after him give gays more clout as you say? The navy decided to name this class of ship after people making significant contributions to civil and human rights. Milk did that for the gay community. There are many other classes of ships named after military personnel.
0:Jmm628 @dankat2 Did your husband become an activist fighting for the equal treatment of others?
0:Tygher Funny to watch a bunch of Cons who never served criticizing a man who served honorably.
1:dinsmo81 @Tygher Serving up BJ's to little boys isn't "serving honorably"
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 @Tygher I agree, so why do you keep doing it?
0:GOTRUMPFORAMERICA @tygher....other than honorably..read the article queerbait..
0:Tygher @GOTRUMPFORAMERICA Oh, an article on Fox couldn't possibly be wrong. That's hilarious!
0:TheImmortalOne @Tygher Why do you keep lying? He was discharged dishonourably.
0:Tygher @TheImmortalOne @Tygher Why do YOU keep lying?

1:TheImmortalOne @Tygher @TheImmortalOne LoL That's what I thought. You get shown that you're supporting a pedophile and you got nothing to say. But like I said, that's what we expect from your ilk.
0:Tygher @TheImmortalOne @Tygher Poor thing, your hatred has melted your brain. Assuming there was a brain to begin with. But it's fun making you dance like a monkey on a chain. Dance, monkey!
0:justinm32 I'm currently serving so take your little smirk and shove it. He didn't serve honorably, which is why he got an other than honorable discharge.
0:Tygher @justinm32 Sure you are, buddy. Sure you are.
0:justinm32 Keep living in denial chickensh!t. I'm totally not sitting in my flightsuit getting ready to go to base. You are so right. You are such a smart little Libby keep telling yourself that you special little flower.

0:Tygher @Ramtoughtom Wishing the death of US military personnel? Sounds like treason to me!
0:rivrrodent @Tygher @Ramtoughtom What would you know about service or treason?
1:rivrrodent Is it really a Navy ship, or just the San Francisco Bay Fairy?
0:destindiver1980 @rivrrodent lol
1:dinsmo81 Honoring pedophiles is long overdue. Does it have to be liberal pedophiles or do other ones get boats too?
0:Tygher @dinsmo81 Yeah, you Cons made a pedophile Speaker of the House! You must be so proud!
0:rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 That was water-carrying republicans. No conservatives were involved.
0:SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 LOL.. sure honey.
0:rivrrodent @SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 When name-calling starts, you have lost
0:Tygher @rivrrodent @SamPatch @Tygher @dinsmo81 Nope, when you put a pedophile two heartbeats away from the Presidency, you've lost. Nice try, though.
0:rivrrodent @Tygher @rivrrodent @SamPatch @dinsmo81 I agree we have lost, but it was no speaker who destroys our military. It is Barack Obama and his employers.
0:SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @SamPatch @dinsmo81 You are such a drama queen. The military is not "destroyed".
0:rivrrodent @SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 I don't believe you have any right to judge the military. When did you serve?
0:SamPatch @rivrrodent @SamPatch @Tygher @dinsmo81 From 1990 to 2012.
0:rivrrodent @SamPatch @rivrrodent @Tygher @dinsmo81 sure
0:Tygher @rivrrodent @SamPatch @Tygher @dinsmo81 I don't believe you should have made a pedophile Speaker of the House, but you seem to be fine with that. Sad.
1:Justasouthernguy Proof the Navy has a sense of humor. I can here it now. U.S.S. Milk full of seaman enter San Francisco.
0:EricPedersen The Left insists that Americans recognize racism today and acknowledge its stain on our history. We already do this daily, from private discussions to national conversations (Ferguson, Baltimore), motion pictures (12 Years a Slave, Selma), and even Black History Month. To that end, Democrats should stop flinging their Confederate flag onto the Grand Old Party. Instead, knock-kneed Republicans should steel themselves for once and demand that Democrats concede that they invented this intimidating standard and deployed it for more than a century to keep blacks down.
1:Ephod @EricPedersen The Flag did not keep blacks from being successful, they did it to themselves. They have more opporiturity than most white people today and its been over thirty years. Most blacks will never be successful, they do not have the drive to push forward, they want something for nothing.
0:EricPedersen Former governor Howard Dean (D., Vt.) told the Democratic National Committee in 2003 that “white folks in the South who drive pickup trucks with Confederate-flag decals on the back ought to be voting with us.” That November, Dean declared: “I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks.” Two years later, he became chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
0:MensLiberum @EricPedersen I think you've missed the point of his comments. "Missing the point" seems to be a common theme with you.
0:EricPedersen As a Democratic governor, Bill Clinton in 1987 signed Act 116, which concerned his state banner. It read: “The blue star above the word ‘ARKANSAS’ is to commemorate the Confederate States of America.”
0:EricPedersen Democratic activists General E. Lee adopted the flag as his national symbol in 1863
0:Rfloyd Who is E. Lee? Is he famous or something?
0:Ephod @Rfloyd Robert E Lee, confederated General, leader of the confederated army. Did you study history?
0:MensLiberum @Ephod @Rfloyd What he was pointing out...which evidently you were not bright enough to pick up on...is that the first poster missed the "Robert" in Robert E Lee.
0:ustruth @MensLiberum < an example of progressives making sure everyone is doing exactly what the left says is PC. GFY, I'm sure you understand very well what those letters mean, right gruber?
0:igaftr @ustruth @MensLiberum Not politically correct, just correct. There is no general E. Lee. Calling people names like "gruber", shows you are an immature child. Grow up.
0:MensLiberum I firmly support the right of Southerners, rednecks, Republicans, and other miscellaneous halfwits to fly the Confederate flag. I particularly support it and encourage it during election years. Please, fly the flag and let minority voters exactly what you think of them. Your help in encouraging these people to vote will be doing your country a tremendous service.
0:TheGrimlock1369 The Confederate Battle Flag to me represents to me the willingness to stand up to an obsessive Federal Government that enforces its will through violent force. No state ever surrendered its Sovereignty under the Unites States Constitution. During the Philadelphia debates that was one of the main issues. The states ONLY surrendered 18 power that the Federal Government of the newly formed REPUBLIC would have the power to enforce. Also didn't South Carolina have the oldest Constitution that predates the US Constitution. Now that basically means that the Confederate Battle Flag represents standing up to tyranny and oppression of a tyrannical government. The war for independence from British Oppression was fought for the same reason as the civil war. The civil war was not fought over slavery...it was fought over the belief that the federal government did not have the authority to dictate to the states...(minus a constitutional admin.) Slavery was wrong and terrible blight on our past. The Confederate Battle Flag is part of our history and our southern heritage.
0:Rolandw1 @TheGrimlock1369 The Federal Government violates the constitution left and right. Read the Judge's piece, "Imagine America without the Constitution" to see just a few clear examples. Our nation was intended to be one of numerous separate sovereign States, yielded limited authority to a central government for the purpose of patrolling the coasts for piracy, minting currency, and other things that a Federal government would be able to do more efficiently than all the States separately. Lincoln would undoubtedly role over in his grave if he would have seen how the Federal Government would have used the Civil War to strip states of their rights and powers… The Federal government just votes itself more power year after year.
0:jb20072 @TheGrimlock1369 Silly people with silly ideas - Yep that flag means something.
0:MensLiberum @TheGrimlock1369 That and slavery.
0:ustruth @MensLiberum Just flag this soros paid troll as spam. It's that time of month so emotions is all it has to operate on. Gruber
0:igaftr @ustruth @MensLiberum He is correct, and any that call anyone "gruber" is clearly a child. Grow up. If you have something to refute, refute it.
1:JohnnyPatriot14 None of these Liberals understand that Judge because they are the ones who infiltrate the Government. This is what happens when you let people in illegally, take people in from hostile to America areas and when you let people like Vallerie Jarrett, Barack Obama or Van Jones head departments that impact people. Liberal fantasy playing a dangerous game with reality....
0:CarpeNoctem Hispanic people = SC will take down its Confederate flag? That's a new one.
0:MensLiberum @JohnnyPatriot14 There you go thinking again. Please, leave it to people equipped and qualified to do it correctly.
0:Rolandw1 On April 4, 1818, a plan was passed by Congress in which the flag was changed to have 20 stars, with a new star to be added when each new state was admitted, but the number of stripes would be reduced to 13 so as to honor the original colonies. ● 10 million+ Estimated number of Native Americans living in land that is now the United States when European explorers first arrived in the 15th century ● Less than 300,000 Estimated number of Native Americans living in the United States around 1900 4 Million Slaves in 1860 who granted had a bad 100+ years even after slavery "ended", or dropping a continents entire population to 0.3% of it's original number.... Maybe we should be more concerned with the atrocities done to the natives of America. Maybe they should be slightly more offended by the flag flying over the White House. Many people who love the constitution would prefer the Gadsen Flag (Don't Tread on Me) replace the old, clearly offensive, stars and bars design anyway. Hug an ancestor of a slave. Cry for an ancestor of an actual native of the continent we all strive to make a better home for all of us.
0:HoorahAmerica @Rolandw1 You do know the vikings come here before the asians crossed the land bridge right?
0:Rolandw1 @HoorahAmerica @Rolandw1 As much as 25% of the DNA of the North Eastern North American natives was European in origin. How many hundreds of years and what percentage of their DNA before they were considered native by you sir? Or are we all only native to Africa? 125,000 to 60,000 years isn't that long really is it...
0:igaftr @Rolandw1 @HoorahAmerica Genetics has proven that information to be outdated. I would suggest a Nova series called the First Ones. It will fill you in on the latest information we have gotten from genetics.
0:CynicalRant In the real world, God gives us freedom to suffer the consequences of our inappropriate words and deeds.

0:winston12 Now we are fighting over a flag? Some Indians are against the American flag. Where does all this end?
0:RobRoy99 @winston12 True, more hate, more carnage, more destruction has been done under the Stars and Stripes than under the Confederate battle flag. Japenese incarcerated, and even some Germans. Native Americans wiped out almost, the rest placed on forced marches to rival the Bataan death march in WW2. Remember Trail of Tears and women giving birth or having miscarriages along the way, marched every day across hundreds of miles. Deliberately infected blankets with smallpox given to old men, women, children, in order to wage germ warfare against them. Deliberate bombing of civilian centers in Germany and Japan instead of only industrial targets. Thousands wiped out in a fiery holocaust in just 2 days in Hiroshima and Nagasaki using atomic weapons. Yes, if there's a flag that should be retired because it's displayed hate and excess of bloodshed it's the Stars and Stripes. When placed beside that record, the Stars and Bars comes off looking almost saintly.
0:igaftr @winston12 People in India are against the American flag?
0:49er so if FOX thinks racist hate speech should be protected why is FOX so up in arms about ISIS hate speech and should their flag be protected too?
1:peprman @49er Obama has one.
0:valannin "The State has no business expressing opinions on anything, and it is required to protect ha te" At least he's consistent. Remember, Judge Napolitano is the one who, in an April 2015 O'Reilly interview, defended the AFDI who wanted to post advertisements caIIing for the kiIIing of Jews.
0:Rolandw1 @valannin FREEDOM is HILARIOUS to some. A necessity to others. Our forefathers believed in certain inalienable rights... Many of us do not laugh at people like you who would pursue perceived safety at the cost of our freedoms. We BELIEVE in the Bill of Rights.
0:igaftr @Rolandw1 @valannin There are no such things as inalienable rights.
0:azolfos There is NO entity in America that will ever oppress my 1st Amendment right which also includes any individual in government office. Obama, by ordering retail outlets to stop sales of a flag has become a domestic enemy of the 1st Amendment.
0:valannin @azolfos You think the President "ordered" five separate retailers to stop selling fIags? What a nutter.
1:peprman @valannin @azolfos He probably did, Muzzy
0:azolfos Obama is demanding the erasure of American history by funneling hate. The Nazis did exactly the same thing and over 6 million people died. Make no mistake, the Democratic national Communist agenda is to socialize America and oppress the Constitution.
0:justme33355 @azolfos YES, it is. Obama hates this country and our freedom and is intentionally destroying it.

0:PaulPiper9 Hate gets a bad rap. We were given the ability to make judgements. I hate violence against the weak, I hate coffee, I hate House (Hugh Lorry is terrible.) Embrace your hate. You have a human right to it. The real hate is shutting down free speech
0:justme33355 @PaulPiper9 Oh, come on, he's not that bad.
0:flrlegal Funny, some people cannot see why Blacks are offended by the confederate flag. It just amazes me. The whole purpose of the confederacy and its constituiton was to allow the continued enslavement of Black people. No state could be apart of the confederacy unless they allowed the practice of slavery. If you do not believe that, then I strongly urge you to read both the US and confederate constitution. The whole purpose of the civil war was to continue the horrible act of slavery in the south. With that, I say now to take the rag down and put it in a museum.
0:br782 @flrlegal It's shocking how many people just argue it is southern pride. No it is not. You can be proud of where you are from without displaying a flag that reminds people of the horrible attrocities their ancestors lived through.
0:phillip barker @br782 @flrlegal If it was their ancestors that lived thru it, then they get to choose whether to acknowledge it or not. Why is it your business?
0:phillip barker @flrlegal The "whole purpose" was not slavery, and the vast majority of those who fought for the South did not own slaves. Many were ambivalent with respect to it. But, what drove the conflict most was the idea that the States were not subservient to the United States, and had a contractual right to withdraw from it. New York was the first to test this during the first "civil war" of 1812, when NY's legislature drafted articles of succession. Had the Brits decided to back off after burning D.C., NY and other Eastern States may have tried to leave the Union. The Southern States might have said "good riddance". The issue of the Confederacy certainly contained the ongoing issue of slavery, but its primary issue was "States rights", a battle that continues to this day.
0:br782 @phillip barker @flrlegal Whatever other issues were involved do not matter. In 2015 we remember it as slavery. So the confederate flag is now associated with slavery. That is why it must go.
0:LeeVT @br782 @phillip barker @flrlegal not we, you. That's what it means to you.
1:gcruse56 @br782 @phillip barker @flrlegal I will fly it from now on, I will not be a slave to the PC police.
0:mc6521 Treason is as treason does , pull down and burn that no good rebel flag. It's not a god given right to side with treason,freedom of speech is a Constitutional Right.....God did not sign the Constitution ,MEN signed that document in spite of both the Crown and the Church of England. You can have your so called divine right and your divine might our government has neither and never shall. It will always be obedient to the Citizens of the United States or else.
0:BelieversKnow @mc6521 Treason is as treason does, your right our goverment is full treason. Trying to give our enemy a nuke.

0:Telesia2 @mc6521 : Son, I'm going to give you some words of advice. I'll ask you to heed them, please: LAY OFF THE CAFFIENE!.Any questions... don't ask 'em.
0:phillip barker @Telesia2 @mc6521 Ha! I like your response better than mine!
0:PaulPiper9 Incomprehensible, inaccurate and wacky.
0:Rolandw1 @mc6521 One minute you claim to believe in Freedom of Speech. The next you want to silence speech you do not agree with... IN THE SAME POST. Freedom of speech is about ALL speech being free. Not just the speech you like or agree with. Wow.
0:br782 I find it funny that people are talking about freedom of speech. Nobody said you can't fly a flag at home. They are just saying the state government shouldn't do it.
0:Buckeyesnumber1 @br782 So what are your thoughts on affirmative action?
0:br782 @Buckeyesnumber1 @br782 Not a huge fan - state by state issue.
0:Buckeyesnumber1 @br782 @Buckeyesnumber1 Me neither
0:CarpeNoctem Very few people are anymore.
0:DemocracyManifest Our government has three branches: Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. The First Amendment only talks about what Congress can do. There's nothing in the Constitution about the Executive or Judicial branch not limiting speech, and those branches do it routinely when it serves their interest. Stop perpetuating myths foxbots.
0:br782 @DemocracyManifest Very incorrect - the First Amendment applies to citizens - not any branch of Government.
0:DemocracyManifest @br782 @DemocracyManifest You need a refresher course.
0:br782 @DemocracyManifest @br782 And I think you need high school.
0:br782 @DemocracyManifest @br782 Not to mention there is no freedom of speech issue here at all
0:DemocracyManifest Freedom of speech is a myth. Few seem to understand that the First Amendment does not confer ANY absolute right of free speech. What it does is place a limit on the power of one branch of government to control speech, the legislative branch. And even that limit is more myth than reality.
0:br782 @DemocracyManifest That's not true. The First Amendment applies to all citizens. It does not apply to any branch of the Government.
0:Rolandw1 @DemocracyManifest "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech..." I believe the other 2 branches to clearly be implied. Why don't you?
0:BelieversKnow You think that flag is terrible and it is. these politicians need to do something with the isis flag full of hate. they have taken thousand's of innocent lives in the last couple years. Under the isis flag they are killing as we speak. People stop thinking about yourselves and what happen a hundred years ago. Open your eyes and look at today. Pray for your brothers and sisters in Christ that our politicians will stop the genocide.

0:BelieversKnow @pop555 @BelieversKnow yes they are where you been
0:pop555 @BelieversKnow @pop555 I am right here and I don't see any. some of my neighbors fly the confederate flag though
0:BelieversKnow @pop555 @BelieversKnow it flying high here thats why Americans are joining Isis
0:BelieversKnow @pop555 @BelieversKnow now whos the nut job
0:justme33355 @pop555 @BelieversKnow You are wrong. Get educated and find out the truth. There have been people flying it. Very sick.
0:CarpeNoctem The ISIS flag isn't flying from any state Capitol buildings, is it?
0:phillip barker @CarpeNoctem Not yet! And, given Obama is a lame duck...we may be safe for a while
0:justme33355 @phillip barker @CarpeNoctem Don't count on it.
0:BelieversKnow @CarpeNoctem it flying high here thats why Americans are joining Isis
0:tessaprn @CarpeNoctem Keep traveling in this same direction and it will!
0:justme33355 @CarpeNoctem If Obama has his way, it WILL be flying from all 57 of them.
0:phillip barker @justme33355 @CarpeNoctem Too funny!!!!!
0:br782 @BelieversKnow Why can't we look at both issues?
0:BelieversKnow @br782 @BelieversKnow i do i just said both flags are terrible
0:DemocracyManifest Protecting hatred preserves hatred. GOP/FOX spin team must be commended for continually massaging narratives to suit their angle.
0:pop555 @DemocracyManifest You are falling in to communism and we will fight you . we will never give in to it
0:phillip barker @DemocracyManifest You miss the whole point, you "intellectual lightweight". Freedom is about protecting speech..whether or not YOU like what is being said!!
0:andylit @DemocracyManifest So, you object to the 1st Amendment?
0:pop555 @andylit @DemocracyManifest yes communists try to shut you up any way they can. the political correctness is the start of it
0:tessaprn @DemocracyManifest My angle is do not tread on me and I will not tread on you. Try to take my GOD given rights and you best bring a lot of back up!
0:justme33355 @DemocracyManifest We have freedom of speech. That means all speech, not just speech that you agree with.
0:br782 As a white southerner - there is nothing wrong with southern pride. But we should not be flying a flag that reminds all African Americans that our relatives once owned their Great or Great Great grandparents Every time they see this flag they are reminded that white America used to own their relatives as property. Why on Earth should we keep perpetuating this??
0:GentleAnswer @br782 Good point.
0:delainey @br782 That's ridiculous.
0:br782 @delainey @br782 How on earth is that ridiculous?
0:CarpeNoctem She doesn't know.
0:delainey @br782 @delainey How can you know what is in another one's thoughts?
0:CarpeNoctem Ah, so you know he's right. Figures.
0:br782 @delainey @br782 So you would be ok with your government flying the flag of a group that kidnapped your grandmother and used her as a slave?
0:CarpeNoctem (not to mention a flag whose SOLE PURPOSE was as that of an enemy state)
0:br782 @CarpeNoctem Another good point.
0:tessaprn @CarpeNoctem Enemy state? Tells me you not only do not know your country's history you also are not up on why the states felt that they could secede.
1:delainey @br782 @delainey The USA has paid dearly and still does for that smudge in history, but these types of actions perpetuate racism, keeps it alive. I guess liberals are the true white apologists.
0:CarpeNoctem I agree. Flying a flag that symbolizes racism perpetuates racism. Time to take it down.
0:nemo007 @CarpeNoctem what flag is that? confederate flag never internationally promoted racism, slavery maybe but it also represents southern patriotism...
0:CarpeNoctem Yeah, you're right. The flag representing a people defending slavery in no way represents any racism. If you want to demonstrate your American patriotism in the south, FLY AN AMERICAN FLAG! Not the flag of an enemy state.
0:tessaprn @CarpeNoctem I am very proud of the America Flag. Maybe you need to learn some more about what occurred under this flag since the first day it was raised. You really should stop being so melodramatic, not becoming at all.
0:br782 @delainey @br782 Really? "Smudge in history." Kidnapping thousands and enslaving them is not a "smudge." I am southern and I have pride without ever having touched that racist flag. It is extremely hateful and should have been retired (well, it was before the civil rights movement) years ago.
0:tessaprn @br782 @delainey I'm not understanding this kidnapping point. Be real. Other countries took by force their own people and sold them for a coin. Stop attempting to portray this country as being the only one that participated in this evil trade.
1:justme33355 @tessaprn @br782 @delainey Yes, there are LOTS of countries that have been and are far worse. There are still lots of slaves in the ME and Africa.
1:RaySims @br728, See you don't have a clue, the grandmother was nabbed by her own people and sold to slave traders(not from America), the best were sold in S America, the scag was sold in America.
0:CarpeNoctem It's amazing to me that you all think the fact that some blacks owned slaves somehow makes it all ok. By the way; you were the last to know.
0:justme33355 @CarpeNoctem It is a fact that many blacks owned many slaves. That does not make it okay, but neither does it make white ownership any worse. There are still many blacks owning slaves today, just not here.
0:br782 @RaySims Your lack of knowledge is astounding.
0:tessaprn @br782 @delainey Kidnapped? How about that flag where the same grandmother could be lynched or kept from ordering and eating a hamburger next to a white person? Where does this end with removing of all things offensive?
0:justme33355 @tessaprn @br782 @delainey Liberals want to remove EVERYTHING that THEY do not agree with, including the Constitution.
0:andylit @br782 Did you miss the point of the article? This isn't about what we "should" do. It is about unlawfully restricting that which we have a right to do.
0:CarpeNoctem I must have missed the case where a state prevented an individual from flying a confederate flag on their own property.
0:BellatrixLestrange2 @CarpeNoctem Thats just people trying to spin it like its being ban.
0:CarpeNoctem Typical Fox.
1:CanadianStormtrooper A WHITE MAN WHO IS A WAR VETERAN- WITH A YOUNG WHITE DAUGHTER WHO NEEDS A LIFE SAVING OPERATION - STUDIES FOR 20 YEARS TO BECOME A SCIENTIST, AND A NON WHITE WOMAN FROM A WEALTHY FAMILY FROM COMMUNIST CHINA WHO HAS STUDIED FOR 1 YEAR TO ATTEMPT TO BECOME A SCIENTIST, BOTH ENROLL AT THE SAME COLLEGE AND SHE IS ACCEPTED OVER HIM DUE TO THE MARXIST AFFIRMITIVE ACTION LAW. WHEN HE RETURNS HOME AND HIS DAUGHTER ASKS WHY HE WAS TURNED AWAY FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE MONEY FOR HER OPERATION, WHICH HE STUDIED HARD FOR HE HAS TO TELL HIS DAUGHTER IT IS BECAUSE HIS SKIN IS THE SAME COLOUR HIS DAUGHTER'S IS.

1:iceberg1 In 1975 I couldn't get a job in Bellingham Washington. Everywhere I went, 6 of the major companies to which I applied, had multiple openings, but I didn't qualify for any of them. Oh, I had the education and I had the experience, but what I didn't have? I didn't have the correct ethnic background! I was Caucasian with no "diversity" (code for minority) status. At the "Unemployment Office", as it was called at the time, many of the people with the correct "diversity" were standing in line to receive their Unemployment checks. As I got up to the counter I asked why so many "people of color" didn't apply at the industries I had applied to for a job. I stated each company by name and the number of positions open and asked why these people couldn't go to work to fulfill the "quota" so I could take a position with one of the companies I had listed. The person behind the counter was a "person of color" and her response was short and to the point. I needed to move along so the next person could receive their benefit check. Jobs, education and now wealth are to be "adjusted" to match the outcome desired of the population of The United States of America! That my friends is Socialism! Since the government Establishment could not push legislation to make all people "equal" the SCOTUS has taken up the challenge and will dictate that design! God help us all!
1:troll @iceberg1 Been there... in the 70's i worked temp jobs from factories gas stations digging ditches to landscaping & self employment multiple refusals for decent jobs that stemmed from the fact that good companies had a quota & reserved jobs for minorities, refusals for educational grants, scholarships & loans, while my visible & gender minority peers received full rides(even though many were far better off than I, and over 40 years in the workforce living with affirmative action, minorities in supervision edicts, diversity initiatives, inclusive initiatives, women in non traditional roles... ... ... the government cant legislate equality all it can do is discriminate against certain demographics and it has done that with flying colors(no pun intended) look at any state or local government they are (at least where I live dominated by minorities far above their respective % in society the same goes for construction work and the service industry... … We are no longer a free country.

0:iceberg1 "3 percent of students at America’s most selective college and universities come from the 25 percent of families with the lowest incomes, while 72 percent come from the 25 percent of families with the highest incomes." Students who can afford to pay for a better college will now have no advantage over students who don't. Affirmative Action applied to wealth, what's next? Affirmative action applied to...............short people?
0:Vincentgarcia @iceberg1 so you should have an advantage cause you can pay? not intelligence
1:JamesRJones Hmmm? Sacrificing the future of our nation at the alter of diversity, sounds like a the perfect plan for ignorant people to support. MLK would not support this stupidity.
0:Stinkypants @JamesRJones right on!
0:vetteacher Discrimination is alive and well in America. We just call it affirmative actions. If discrimination is wrong then reverse discrimination is just as wrong with all Do Respect to the SCOTUS.
0:JamesRJones @vetteacher There is no "reverse discrimination", there is only discrimination. Liberals invented "reverse discrimination" as a term to imply the origin of all discrimination was created by and practiced only by Caucasians
0:LibertyIsOutOfControl Must be all that "privilege" I keep hearing about
0:jimtaryon What nonsense. The most qualified candidate should be chosen. Punishing them for being the wrong color is not somehow more progressive. Its the same old racism using different words.
0:AliamRationem @jimtaryon It was a policy developed in response to different times with different problems. Those problems still exist, but they've changed. Perhaps it's time for policy to evolve as well.I'm not sure I agree with every idea discussed in the article, but some of them seem sensible. And in contrast to affirmative action, these policies could achieve the same thing while tending to favor the most qualified candidate, as you say.
0:LibertyIsOutOfControl No need for affirmative action. Just take race out of the equation and admit students on a number system only; top scores get in. If every college in the country is packed full of Jews, Asians, and white Europeans, so be it.
1:vetteacher @LibertyIsOutOfControl That's called the Merit System and requires students to actually study and perform. Sometimes it seems minorities think they have somehow "earned" an easier path. Could we call the "Minority Privilege"?
1:EZinTexas If a black leaves high school and can't sign his name or read above a 6th grade level, what makes anyone think he will do any better in college...? Everyone doesn't belong in college. The country needs thousands of burger flippers and broom pushers.
1:vetteacher @EZinTexas Not just low income unskilled. We need plumbers and mechanics too. You are right college isn't for everyone. Work is.
1:jerry999 What nonsense. The percentage of Hispanics and Blacks actually graduating is dismal. Junior colleges are overflowing because the Blacks and Hispanics are not prepared and junior colleges have to teach them the last two years of high school so they are capable of taking college level classes. Look at the major university graduation data and you will see that Hispanics and Blacks don't get degrees in STEM, they receive degrees in Black Studies and Hispanic Studies. Then the Government has a requirement for quotas of Blacks and Hispanics for any company that provides goods or services for the Government. So we will have small armies of students that know nothing that will be working at US companies. Seems just like the old Soviet Union. The United States has no future.
1:StealthF22 @jerry999 Maybe that is why the US is 39th in math and science among all civilized countries!

0:dusty911 What exactly is racial diversity? The liberals insist race is just a social construct and that we're really all just alike. So which is it? Do the races differ or not? There is no diversity in diversity if we are all just alike.
1:StealthF22 @dusty911 We are all alike. However, we are treated differently for political reasons. The dems have to have 'victims' so they can get more voters. It started with blacks, next to woman groups and then to Hispanics. Who is next? Muslims?
0:shortdangerousbooks What "income diversity" do you mean? High school grads don't have any income. Oh, you mean the income of the PARENTS if such exist. In other words, you intend to reward unproductive or irresponsible parents, and penalize good parents. That's the inevitable result of equal-outcome socialism, it destroys a meritocracy.
0:underdog58 @shortdangerousbooks If the government subsidizes anything, you re guaranteed to see more of it.
0:uzurbrain @shortdangerousbooks It also creates another problem. If/when implemented unless they include low (and I mean very low) SAT or ACT scores then the color diversity will disappear, thus, ACLU, etc. will file lawsuits that not enough of this color or that color are represented.
0:chagrin If the college grading systems weren't biased in favor of the under-represented this whole think might work. Unfortunately, having made the commitment to diversity, professors allow their bias to affect the grading of work that is evaluated subjectively. It is a disservice to the taxpayers paying the freight and the student who wrongly believe they have earned their grades.
0:ancienttexan @chagrin Watching college students being interviewed on the streets and asked simple common knowledge questions...."higher education" is a cruelty joke.
0:StealthF22 @chagrin It also lowers the standards for achieving!
0:joshisgems And Wayne University did away with the math requirement and tucked in a class on "diversity." SMH.

0:ancienttexan @Bitterssweet exactly...the words are NOT interchangeable.
0:sanderdog1 How about we just adopt Bernie's Idea and send every student to college after High School where many did poorly already. Set up a jurnior Junior College to teach them first what they failed to learn already. To be sure some dirt poor kids deserve to go to college but not if they blew off HS.
0:DustinG @sanderdog1 So a far greater group of working poor kids shouldn't get that opportunity because of the small percentage of problem kids you and your ilk focus on.
0:underdog58 @DustinG @sanderdog1 That's what the GI Bill is for. Assuming that you can graduate HS and stay out of jail, Uncle Sam can get you a free ride.

0:steely49 Diversity to the Democrats means a mixed demographic group with identical psychographics. Can you say "thought police".
0:DustinG @steely49 No, its just a matter of giving a small percentage of kids a chance. Most of the kids going to college will be the same kids that would have gone anyway.
1:threedaughters If we stop admitting people into college in the name of diversity who are less qualified to succeed, maybe we can compete on the international stage.

0:insideout26529 I'm Asian. And can't afford college even though I'm in the upper 1% of my graduating class. As a race, we are by far fewer in number in the general population than Blacks or Hispanics. Yet I don't qualify for Affirmative Action. Why isn't my "diversity" valued the same as other minorities? Why the double standard?
0:LeftandRightareWrong @insideout26529 Because affirmative action is by its very nature, racist. It contends that races are superior and inferior. That members of racial groups should be promoted and demoted in an attempt to -- do what?
0:Jim Murray @insideout26529 From what I've read, some colleges actually put a cap on asian admissions. It seems that test qualifications, or anything else is just ignored. The colleges simply limit the number of asian student population. I'm talking about american asians. The number of foreign asians appears to be an entirely different matter. Colleges appear to welcome them with open arms.
0:adwhatnow @Jim Murray @insideout26529 Probably because they can charge higher tuition to non-nationals. For universities, it is ALL about the buck. Pious hypocrites.
0:threedaughters @adwhatnow @Jim Murray @insideout26529 Yes -- they don't have to offer them financial aid. They pay full price.
0:delegate @insideout26529 If you are actually a highly qualified student, you can find a scholarship and financial aid to attend college, without "Affirmative Action" becoming involved. I think maybe you are just posting some "feelings" not founded on fact.
1:threedaughters @delegate @insideout26529 Consider that the number of scholarships that are available to non-caucasian, non-asian students is much higher than for those two classes. Those scholarships also have lower standards to apply.
1:ByteMeCommies @insideout26529 you mean you can't afford Harvard...
0:StealthF22 @insideout26529 Simple! The dems want as many voters that they can 'buy' as a group. It's all about staying in power. Creating 'victims', political correctness and the welfare system has always been a tool of the left.

0:johnnonothing It is ironic that banning candy soda and snacks from the poor is punishment , when all of those things lead to ill health and a health burden in the billions among those able to buy their soda, candy, and snacks. I bet it cost more in the long run to pay for the problems created by this eating and "working" life style.
0:kmillerscats Too many people on the dole. Never before in US history have we had this many folks receiving some form of public assistance. With roughly half the population working and paying taxes this is unsustainable. This is democrat leadership for you.
0:johnnonothing @kmillerscats It depends on how you define public assistance, some consider letting homeowners write off their property tax as public assistance.
1:WiltonManors " after the requirements largely were suspended by the Obama administration." No wonder blacks vote democrat.
0:kmillerscats This it what happens in socialist societies. You become a government dependent. The government makes all the rules for you. You have no right to make decisions- you gave that right away when you took the welfare. No candy, cake, pie or soda for you.
0:Sierra415 I pay federal income taxes. So should DONALD
0:WiltonManors @Sierra415 Donald pays more in federal income taxes in one year than you will pay over your lifetime.

0:Sierra415 Paid 0 in two years we've seen. I don't believe he pays thus no income taxes releases
0:romags1303 I have to work if I want to eat, they can too. We need to provide the same service we provide to enlist personnel in the military, barracks, & food. If it's good enough for our soldiers, etc.
0:johnnonothing @romags1303 So you get food stamps, because you met the work requirement. Unless you are a saying you have a job that pays enough to buy your own food.
0:johnnonothing Who benefits from the work requirement? The businesses that hire people at a wage that is insufficient, but allows the person to get a subsidy from the State government. The business man is very happy. He can continue to pay less than a living wage with confidence the State will use tax payer money to feed his employees.
0:Sierra415 Walmart employees get food stamps and Medicaid

1:obamasmom Maine followed the Kansas lead in 2014. In the first three months, the number of able-bodied adults without children on food stamps fell by almost 80 percent. Can Chimps read?.. I guess not... if chimps could read then policies would be changed.

0:Justinsatiable @Sierra415 Oh, I'll bet Illinois, New York, and Cali are so much better off with their social/govt. programs?

1:ConcernedCitizen93 @Sierra415 doesn't work, i can't even count the number of times i've heard people say they don't care if they get pregnant again or have another kid, that's just a pay raise to them.
0:Sierra415 Not my experience. With family planning the average Welfare family went from 4 to 2 kids.
1:ConcernedCitizen93 @Sierra415 all i'm saying is i physically hear that all the time. I don't really care if you believe it or not because it doesn't change the fact it is truth so i'm not going to argue the point with you. Also, I'm not saying that what you just said isn't true either but I'd be willing to bet that for every person who attends family planning sessions because they want to improve themselves there's 20 who have no desire to do so and just want to milk the system.
0:Sierra415 Welfare workers used to take family planning kits on home visits, refer for tubos, and well received. Then the religious nuts stopped that
0:Sierra415 Yes. Dummie. Do some research
0:Justinsatiable @Sierra415 Oh, is that why the govt., who typically slants numbers in their favor, reports billions in fraud? Huh, where is the fraud coming from? Your adult toy purchases?
1:kmillerscats When I was a growing up, food stamps were for families that went through some kind of horrible disaster - usually widows who suddenly lost their husbands. Today food stamps are given out indiscriminately. Even illegals found ways to get free food- at tax payer's expense.
0:Sierra415 Never was that
0:RayzorRay @Sierra415 yeh okay! You're prob on welfare right now.

1:kmillerscats @mastersundholm You should find yourself a baby mamma or two......make a few out of wedlock babies....get custody of them. Then you can get some food stamps!
0:Michael S. @mastersundholm I got laid off from my job last December. I was making $87,000 a year and my wife only makes $32,000. I tried to go for unemployment in Pennsylvania and was declined because I made too much money. They seriously denied me unemployment because I made too much money at what was my previous job. They said I had to wait 3 months before I would qualify!!! I told them I have no income the day after my last day at work. They still did not care. Getting laid off in December is the worst month to get laid off in. Took me two months to find a job that is making what I was previously. Now because I could not qualify for unemployment I did pick up side jobs with a family member that did residential electrical work. Otherwise my bills would have defaulted.
0:Justinsatiable @Michael S. @mastersundholm Saddened by your testimonial. This is the unfortunate world created by this narcissist in office! The system is broke and helping only those he believes need help...

0:Chrisf1451 I am a current recipient of food stamps. I agree that people who are able to work should work while on public assistance. I think we need to fix our economy first though. I have been unemployed for the past 9 years. I have applied to thousands of jobs over the past 9 years and still have nothing to show for it. Out of the thousands of jobs I have applied for, I have only been called in for an interview half a dozen times. I have a bachelors degree and yet no one will hire me!
0:RAYUSA1 @Chrisf1451 Do volunteer work. If you do a good job and let people know that you are looking for a job, you will get a job offer from one of the business owners that are supporting that charity. Another approach is to get work as a temporary through a "temp" agency. Many "temps" do a good job and are offered regular employment at a company that uses temp agencies. If you follow either of these paths, work hard and get along with your fellow workers, you will get regular employment.
1:kmillerscats @Chrisf1451 I wish you luck in the future. You strike me as someone who does not want to be on food stamps. That is not always the case with many welfare recipients.
0:Songkran I was on welfare and incapable of working at one time but signed up for a few hours volunteer work a couple of times a week. It made me feel that I 'gave back' as much as I was capable, and that I was actually still engaged with life, with people, that I could offer something needed, even as I was in need. I was very appreciate of having the help available until I could get back on my feet but a 'welfare life' deforms your spirit, if its not already deformed enough to find that life acceptable. The essentials of power, transport, etc are so expensive, and the knockbacks so demoralising and the eventual inertia so debilitating, that sometimes you sink into despondency. If eligable welfare recipients were matched up with something they could align to personally ( I worked at a farm and an emergency relief food outlet , both which I liked), i could see it working for all concerned. Unfortunately, I could see this becoming an almost work-for - the-state situation and taken to its end-point, that gives me the heebie jeebies.
0:TedHurtz @Songkran and your experience is exactly what welfare should be. Temporary, empowering. it is depressing being unemployed. working those hours not only give back to the economy, they do wonders for your self esteem and help you back into the work force. these free loaders that use welfare as a way of life as they work under the table are the real problem, and under obama it seems that the handouts have gotten out of control. turning into a welfare state.
0:opaque/584efea0-7ff6-11e2-bb02-000f20980440 @Songkran I don't agree and I don't believe you.
1:me21950 @opaque/584efea0-7ff6-11e2-bb02-000f20980440 @Songkran I personally know people who get $800+ in food stamps claiming children who do not live with them. They sell them for cash drugs liquor and cigarettes. They sleep all day and party all night. Then their are those who are actually trying to get ahead that are denied any benefits or less than $100 a month help and working 2 to 3 jobs. Need better screening and follow up inspections.
0:Novelist56 The LOVE on this site for Jesus is overwhelming. All this we should help the poor get back on their feet, how we should feed them like Jesus fed five thousand.

We need to overall the program but in a positive way requiring recipients complete food and health educational classes monthly to retain benefits while limiting what can be purchased. This program literally costs tax payers 1/10 a penny per year to fund yet provides many with food who need healthy options.

0:Israeli25 @RacistIsrael There is racism in Israel like in every other country, but more reasonable that less... When the question of racism against Ethiopian Jews was raised, Israel proved its ability to fight it with the most effective and vigorous ways. I bet this problem will be solved before you will be capable to determine your self autonomously, and not in identification with your anti-semitic hate.
0:jhkswim2 Long live the Jewish State of Israel, with all the land it needs to be safe and secure and with its original, ancient, eternal, and undivided blessed capital city of Jerusalem.
0:Dvandal @jhkswim2 Not to get into a huge debate; but if there were any descendants of the people of Jericho - I wonder how they would feel about Israel's 'historic claim' to the land. According the bible; the ancient Hebrews slaughtered them wholesale so I guess its a moot point.
0:jhkswim2 Israel has as much right to the land that it sits on as America has or any other nation has to the lands that they sit on.
0:claymccrea @jhkswim2 "As I urged you when I went into Macedonia, stay there in Ephesus so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines any longer or to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies. Such things promote controversial speculations rather than advancing God's work--which is by faith." "It is not as though God's word had failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel." "For they are not all Israel which are of Israel; neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children… but the children of promise are counted for the seed."
1:jhkswim2 Yes, BLM is a terrorist organization.
1:BillPistulka The opinion of this person was invalidated in the first sentence, "which has done so much good in raising awareness of police abuses" . "So much good" are you kidding me? So much good at perpetuating racism, and conflict. Blocking roads and rioting and threatening people? Good? Tell ya what, if BLM wants my support, it needs to just go away. I support that. And of course, why Fox reprinted this crap from the boston globe is beyond me.
0:DustinG @BillPistulka Hey, pass a law against cell phone videos and you will get your wish for this all to go away.
0:LeftandRightareWrong @BillPistulka If not for cell phones and body cams more cops might be unfairly out of a job or worse.
1:claymccre @BillPistulka Why was it reprinted? Consider it a clue to the 'group' who controls the media.
1:giordant Dershowitz erred when he thought that Black Lives Matter was really dedicated to rooting out police abuses. Their goal was always attacks on whites, especially white cops, whether or not they abused blacks. They are a hate group. Eventually, hate groups get around to hating Jews.
0:DustinG @giordant Its amazing how angry people get when they keep getting shot.
0:LeftandRightareWrong @giordant Who funds BLM? Follow the money!
0:DEGJR5047 BLACK OLIVES MATTER
0:tkswilsonall Why would Blacks support Israel? That's not even logical.
1:Ksp48 @tkswilsonall Huh? Maybe because Jews have been even more pressed than blacks. Maybe because of a shared history of slavery. Maybe because American Jews were in the forefront of the civil rights movement. Maybe because Israel is the only democratic, law based country in the entire middle east.
1:badchef Like all good Americans, Dershowitz is deeply concerned when people attack Israel, a sure sign of anti-Semitism – or so he tells us. As a distinguished civil rights attorney, Dershowitz helped defend O J Simpson but he isn’t defending BLM when they have the audacity to go after Israel. And like all Americans nowadays, Dershowitz closely identifies with his chosen group of American born Israelis, BLM identifies with their chosen group of African Americans – if you’re a loyal American you must enlist in a group which despises other groups. Is this a great country or what?
0:theplan "But singling Israel out and falsely accusing it of “genocide” can be explained in no other way than blatant hatred of Jews and their state." ROFL they send tanks roll over the bodies of new born babies, and it's not a genocide? (seen during the last incursion of Israel on europeanTV) take an aspirin dude and get the facts.
0:jerryprice @theplan I may have misunderstood your comment to be supportive of Palestinians, re read and realized I misunderstood. My other comment is for those who support Palestinians
0:jaxtown @buckeye235 The whole problem is all about racism and hate and you sir are obviously part of the problem! Just like savior Trump, you are very good at placing labels and placing blame, because YOU are part of the problem as well!
0:augustawinter @jaxtown @buckeye235 Jaxtown, BLM is all about hate. And, to boot, they're dopes for calling out Israel. No other ethnic group has supported Black civil rights & freedom more than the Jewish people. I'm not Jewish but I can clearly see that.
1:Keysrat321 Blacks in America are the fast growing population of anti-Semites in the US. Yes you can fact check it.
0:thatChief The terrorist nation of Israel illegally occupies large swaths of the West Bank in direct defiance of International law. Israel should only be approximately 1/3 of the size of what it currently occupies, this means 2/3 of their land is illegally occupied, which is a crime against humanity. Israel somehow managaes to have a worse record for crimes against humanity than even abhorrent places like Iran and Syria. Look it up the information is out there and none of it involves conspiracy nut jobs like Alex Jones.
0:RocD There is no international law against Israel holding the lands they captured in a defensive war. And your claim of a 'worse HR record' than the Arab despots is sheer nonsense. To think that people who can read and write can actually believe anything you've said is beyond comprehension.
1:badchef @RocD Perhaps so but the history of non-Jewish Semites, Muslims, Babylonians (Nebuchadnezzar) and assorted Middle Eastern tribes murdering Jews is long and bloody. But Israel is loyal only to those who defend Jewish interests (Cyrus the Great, a Persian) and violently opposed to those who don’t. Naturally, Israel has a strict immigration policy regarding Palestinians, Israel even built one of those hated Border Walls to keep their nation secure. Is Trump a Jewish name?
1:jhkswim2 Palestinkians have an even stricter policy against Jews. The Palestinkian charter calls for the total elimination of the Jewish state and the genocide of Jews.
1:jerryprice @badchef @RocD Just like any other country we defend our interests and are loyal to those who support and defend our interests until this traitor-in-chief now occupying the White House.
0:xrange2nd75th @thatChief take that up with the UN, or Israel, keep all your self described righteous anger and hate in the Strip.
0:Keysrat321 I think they should go back to the 6 Day War boarders. Isn't that how most countries gained land through war?
0:jerryprice @Keysrat321 disagree. They would not have that land if the other countries had not invaded first. Why does Israel have to give back land won during an invasion of their country? The United States is not being forced to give land back to England, France, Spain or Mexico
1:buckeye235 @thatChief Israel SHOULD be 10X the size to wipe terrorist muslims off the face of the earth.
0:Jeff2000 @thatChief Everything you just said is factually wrong. Go back in your hole!

0:ratherbefishing Sorry Charlie - alligators want kids that taste good not the parents that have good taste (or sense).

0:SFgunrmn @Dusty1948 ug..ug..ly.
0:FrancisP64 This is why the surgeon general states that smoking or drinking while pregnant is bad for an unborn child......this is what we get...brain damaged children.....I love how we now turn "accidents" into political social movements.....An accident is an undesirable incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized
0:MJones54 @FrancisP64 Remember -- spay or neuter your millennials.
0:AMILH I'm sorry, but isn't this woman white? Let's face it, it's cool to to have an issue with white people. She is SO cool. I bet she just can't believe how utterly cool and accepted in all her social circles she really is. So it's not "white privilage" that needs to be stamped out . . .it's "white I wanna be cool".
0:jmgandolfo @AMILH Seems like she has more of a problem with "white I wanna be dead".
0:conservogop DEMS are such clueless and useless animals.
0:jmgandolfo @conservogop But please, you're insulting animals.
0:karvictho When the black child fell into the gorilla cage ... and the gorilla was shot to save the boy ... many people signed a petition to have the mom prosecuted for failing to watch her child. Here an alligator eats a white child ... and there are signs everywhere telling people not to go in the water ... but there are no petitions being signed asking for the boy's dad to be prosecuted. That's the issue .... black people should be condemned ... white people are "privileged" and get a pass and sympathy. For those of you pretending it is otherwise... oh well, you can always be part of the problem instead of part of the solution.
1:toorotten Karvictho; first off the boy didn't "fall" into the Gorilla area - he CLIMBED in! Second, he told his Momma he wanted to go in prior to escaping into the pit! And both Mom and Dad were right next to him but were distracted taking photos! Third off, various stories as to if the Dad was there or not, but he was there. So that boy had 2 parents and 2 siblings old enough to watch over him but ALL were too occupied on Social media to bother watching this lil boy that had to.d his parents that he wanted to climb in!! These deaths have NOTHING at all do with Racism, nor "White Privileges"!! Grow up! Pull up your pants, stop looting your hood and then blah the about not having anything good in your neighborhood! Oh, and BTW, they too could have gone to Disney and gotten their kid eaten by a Gator! They take Food Stamps there ya know!!
0:opsl2407 The sign said no swimming and BTW all black people do not live in the hood and there are 45.2% of White Privileged, victims on welfare vs 25.7% of Black hood living, drug selling thugs according to the US Department of Agricultural 2015 report ijs
0:Jayliam @opsl2407 Please tell me if I I'm getting this right: the US Department of Agriculture states that 45.2% of welfare recipients are "white privilege victims?"
0:hansdelbrucke @toorotten I kind of think you fail to see the real picture: Black child is alive while the white child is dead. This is not racial, it is about life and death.
0:ClownsToTheLeftOfMeJokersToTheRight @karvictho I take it you're femme_esq?
0:ynna deiw @karvictho you are a part of the problem
0:mikejoann @karvictho People like YOU are the problem!
0:yakageddon @karvictho Maybe the family in Florida got more sympathy because their child was killed. I agree that the Chicago family was unnecessarily maligned.
0:RecognizeTheTruth @karvictho It is otherwise: you live in a fantasy world. The problem is people like you and Ms Snarth, the current President, the "reverends" (Al and Jesse), every liberal-socialist, etc. etc. who think that everything is about "phobia", "hate" and "race". Because of the first amendment, your ability to spout the foul libelous statements and baseless accusations is protected. Because of the first amendment, you're going to have to learn to let those who disagree with you continue to disagree. Tragedies happen. Sometimes by our own inattention, and sometimes with no warning or ability to prevent them. When no crime is committed, then those involved in the tragedy should be left alone to grieve.
1:CurbYerLib @karvictho Considering the fact that I'll never be black, I suppose I'll have to settle for being part of the solution.
0:jmgandolfo @karvictho However, it is YOU that is "part of the problem" (in fact, a very LARGE part of the problem)... carrying and spreading your venomous hatred of the human race, and especially "whites. And it would indeed be for the same tragedy that befell this little "white" boy to befall YOU, that would be a much to be desired (and quite poetic) "part of the solution".

0:jmgandolfo @johnwiec How do you know this? Then she would be the "Olivia St. Clair" part?
0:Hunneyblonde I'm also curious. Why would the dad allow the child any where near the water that said "No Swimming". Forget about the bottom of the water having some type problem. It was Florida. Gators can asset water in families pools. So there in open land when that sign would have made any parent more cautious. That Gator laid in wait for that innocent little boy and did what an Alligator known to do. Strike very fast and drag under water. So sad for the family, that I am. The Father will never ever forgive himself. So I really don't think pointing fingers really makes a different at this point. He was the one at the time walking with his Son and that very sad tragic thing happen and that will always be his final remembrance of his child. So heart breaking.
0:RustySchakelford @Hunneyblonde and yet here you are doing just that pointing fingers
0:Lngrn36 @Hunneyblonde Technically they were in compliance with the signs as neither one was swimming. There are thousands of places around the gulf coast that say no swimming and like these signs they are permanent. Sometimes it's as simple as tree stumps being removed to make, as in this case, a man made lake. The owners don't want people hurt on the remaining stumps until they have rotted away. They walked together on a beach and the little boy was in less than 12" of water. Now if the signs that were posted would have said "DANGER ALLIGATORS IN WATER" I could see how you might have a point. However, you do not.
0:jmgandolfo @Lngrn36 Neither does she seem to have a brain, a heart or a soul. Check out the profile photo. Yeah, some "Honeyblonde", huh? SMH
0:FrancisP64 @Hunneyblonde seriously? Now I live in the South and if there is a public area that has ALLIGATORS we post signs that state that....Now if I am going to "Disney" I would NOT expect at a resort type hotel for there to be Gators and if there are they should POST that because someone from some Northern state on vacation is not thinking Gators unless they are at Animal Kingdom.....this is clearly the fault of the hotel not the parents....and it was an accident:An accident is an undesirable incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized

0:ratherbefishing So discriminating alligators chose their victims because they taste good or because they have good taste?
0:Americangrill @ratherbefishing Apparently because of this white privilege deal...:/
1:RecognizeTheTruth @ratherbefishing We really should sue the alligator for not complying with Florida and Federal EEOC (Equal Eating Opportunity Commission) rules as well as Affirmative Action and Diversity requirements. Wrong "race" (actually ethnicity, there is only one race), wrong gender, wrong education and income profile.
0:innocentlivlesmatter I'd still rather take my chances at Disney rather than on the streets of Chicago, especially on weekends.
0:VivianLee @innocentlivlesmatter You have better odds with the alligators. The stats are up to 1847 shot. Probably be over 1900 after the weekend.

1:nastyazzpelosi Brienne of Snarth Uncovered: Olivia St. Clair Long, aka Brienne of Snarth is an attorney who is employed by a Law Firm in Chicago, IL. A little digging on the internet reveals this woman's Hatred towards "white privilege men" This is a ugly example of a misguided human being... if I ever saw one, but nonetheless a stinking POS! Do a little digging and you will find some of the pieces that makes this woman tick. Check out who she is married to!
0:Americangrill @nastyazzpelosi nah, she's not worth another moment of my time.
0:BanGee Then again you can ask her "How does a 2 year old get far enough away from the parent and close enough to get snatched by an alligator unsupervised in a huge public arena?" Bad parenting maybe? Just asking, either way it is very sad.
0:doublellnfl @BanGee I see you know zip about gators.
0:jmgandolfo @doublellnfl @BanGee Or anything else worth knowing.
0:VivianLee @BanGee Most people don't think about alligators in the pond when they are vacationing at Disney. I wonder why they didn't post a warning sign?
0:playtim3izov3r She's right. He should feel the guilt for the rest of his life for ignoiring signs. But millions of dollars will buy a couple of four wheelers and some personal watercraft. That'll help him squash the feelings.

Genius !! I'm sure our descendants 1501 years from now will be so thankful for our lack of forethought as they are being led off to the giant meat grinder.
0:VivianLee @InventPeace It's a COOKBOOK!
0:InventPeace FL protects alligators too much, alligators are serial killers, they eat anything anyone any pet, they can. Sad the media has convinced the public that these killers should be "protected by law"? Hope they learn why some creatures are not desirable neighbors? They should all be re-located to the Everglades (the gators and the media, lol), that would help their tourism and make the rest of FL safer. Same for the Bear issues, Over Development destroys the Bears natural habitat so they have to search for food more and farther, so its mans doing; just Re-Locate them to the Rockies perhaps, that would not require the Bears killed,who are only looking for food most all the times. Too, Disney should have 2 barriers between any dangerous animal or creature and the public. Even a good parent can be caught unawares. Its just human nature to not always be 100% on guard.
0:VivianLee @InventPeace Give it up, Alligators were there first. I don't want to see any species wiped out.
0:BaratinsaneObuma I blame George Bush for I inherited Alligators from the previous Republican administration. If the father had a AR-15 do you think the Alligator would have still taken the boy?
